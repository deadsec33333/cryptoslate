										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) crashed in tandem with stock markets on Oct. 1 as tensions continued to escalate in the Middle East after Israel announced ground operations in Lebanon, which has prompted Iran to take action.</span></p>
<p>The official account of Israel Defense Forces on X <a href="https://x.com/IDF/status/1841155252428390707">shared</a> at 4:36 P.M. UTC that Iran was firing rockets at Israeli territory. <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Additionally, reports claim that Iran is likely to send a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-10-01/middle-east-latest-m1qnx63j-iran-fires-rockets-at-israel-idf-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second wave</a> of missiles targeting Israel in the ensuing hours.</span></p>
<p>As a result, over $489 million was liquidated over the past 24 hours, with the majority of liquidations — $312 million — occurring within the past four hours, according to Coinglass <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData">data</a>.</p>
<p>Long liquidations accounted for $416.6 million of the total, while short liquidations amounted to roughly $73 million.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333333;">According to CryptoSlate data, BTC was trading at $61,598 as of press time, down 3% over the past day</span>.</p>
<h2>Altcoins see heavier losses</h2>
<p>Major altcoins displayed heavier corrections following the news. Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) was down 4.31% as of press time and trading at $2,490, while Solana (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">SOL</a>) was down over 5.51% and trading at $146.8.</p>
<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Toncoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/telegram-open-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TON</a>) and Dogecoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/dogecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOGE</a>) registered the worst performance, tumbling 6.2% and 7.3%, respectively, to $5.33 and $0.1063.</span></p>
<p>The Fear and Greed Index — which measures crypto investors’ sentiment daily — <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/">fell</a> from the greed zone at 61 points to the neutral area at 50 points in 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Gold, dollar surge</h2>
<p>The US equities market also registered losses today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) shrinking 1.1% and the Nasdaq Index pulling back 1.85%. Nvidia (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/nvidia/">NVDA</a>) stocks are down 4%, and Apple (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/apple/">AAPL</a>) shares fell 3.6%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US Dollar Index is up 0.6%, followed by a 1.1% leap registered by the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index (XAU).</p>
<p>Jeroen Blokland, founder of the Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund, <a href="https://x.com/jsblokland/status/1841112732935897457">stated</a> on X that investors are “literally selling” BTC to buy gold amid the intensification of the conflict. However, he added that Bitcoin’s average return as a hedge against geopolitical events has proven to be a good decision since 2020.</p>
<p>Citing a BlackRock report, Blokland <a href="https://x.com/BloklandFund/status/1840749613684277537">highlighted</a> that BTC outpaced the 60-day returns of SPX and gold during the US-Iran conflict and Covid outbreak in 2020, the deflagration of war between Russia and Ukraine in 2022, and the US banking crisis in 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On-chain derivatives weekly trading volumes have been shrinking for the third consecutive week, indicating a potential lack of risk appetite among traders, based on DefiLlama </span><strong><a href="https://defillama.com/derivatives">data</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The declining volume is driven by several factors, including macroeconomic uncertainties like the unclear outcome of the US presidential elections, the rising tensions in the Middle East, and the possibility of no interest rate cuts by the Fed next month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sector&#8217;s weekly trading volume reached $64.6 billion between July 27 and Aug. 2, its highest since mid-May. However, trading activity has been slumping ever since, falling to $62.9 billion the following week and to $40.4 billion last week.</span></p>
<p>Notably, the current week has only recorded $5.11 billion in volume, and with only three days left, the sector is on track to record the lowest weekly volume since early 2023.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arbitrum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/arbitrum/">ARB</a>) is recovering its dominance on weekly volumes this week, with roughly 18% of all on-chain derivatives trading taking place on the network. Hyperliquid follows closely, accounting for 17% of the volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Blast, dYdX, and Solana (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">SOL</a>) are still maintaining their dominant spots in the top five largest blockchains by weekly trading volume, with 11.3%, 10.5%, and 8.8% of the share, respectively.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Room for growth</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the cooling risk appetite among on-chain traders, the decentralized derivatives market has experienced growing popularity in 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, the average monthly trading volume of on-chain derivatives was $51.4 billion during the first half, compared to nearly $235 billion in average volume during the first six months of this year — representing a 357% year-on-year growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newcomers like Blast and Hyperliquid contributed to the growth of the on-chain derivatives market size this year, with $234.8 billion and $266.7 billion of trading volume year-to-date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the trading activity on decentralized platforms is still a meager fraction when compared to their centralized counterparts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><strong><a href="https://www.coinglass.com/exchanges">Coinglass</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Binance alone registered $46.2 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the whole decentralized ecosystem of platforms for derivatives trading registered just $5.1 billion in volume, roughly 11% of the volume traded on just one centralized exchange.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&#8217;s</a> drop to below $50,000 on Aug. 5 marked the largest drawdown in the current cycle, resulting in substantial <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-volatility-slashes-unrealized-profits-sths-hit-the-hardest/">profit losses</a> and liquidations. And while BTC has shown solid signs of recovery since then, consolidating around $60,000, the market still remains cautious as it recently dipped below this psychological support.</p>
<p class="p1">This cautiousness is best seen in the derivatives market, where the futures long/short ratio has stabilized around 1, with longs at 50.16% and shorts at 49.85%.</p>
<figure id="attachment_438494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-438494" style="width: 902px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-438494" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-14-at-15.45.30.png" alt="bitcoin futures long/short ratio exchanges derivatives" width="902" height="805" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-14-at-15.45.30.png 902w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-14-at-15.45.30-300x268.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-14-at-15.45.30-768x685.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-438494" class="wp-caption-text">Table showing the Bitcoin futures long/short ratio across exchanges on Aug. 14, 2024 (Source: <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LongShortRatio">CoinGlass</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This near-equal distribution shows a lack of clear directional bias among traders. The current ratio represents a significant shift from the bullish outlook observed earlier in the month, which peaked on Aug. 8 with a ratio of 1.068.</p>
<figure id="attachment_438493" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-438493" style="width: 1427px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-438493" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-14-at-15.45.04.png" alt="bitcoin futures long/short ratio " width="1427" height="370" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-14-at-15.45.04.png 1427w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-14-at-15.45.04-300x78.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-14-at-15.45.04-1024x266.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-14-at-15.45.04-768x199.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1427px) 100vw, 1427px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-438493" class="wp-caption-text">Chart showing the Bitcoin futures long/short ratio from July 16 to Aug. 14, 2024 (Source: <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LongShortRatio">CoinGlass</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">With perpetual futures becoming the dominant Bitcoin derivatives trading instrument, this lack of directional bias can be easily maintained. On Aug. 5, perpetual futures volume reached $67.88 billion, nearly eight times the spot market volume of $8.58 billion. The perpetual futures to spot volume ratio hit its second-highest level this year on Aug.10, reaching 11.60.</p>
<figure id="attachment_438495" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-438495" style="width: 1427px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-438495" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/perpetual-futuresspot-volume-ratio-1.07-14.08.png" alt="perpetual futures:spot volume ratio 1.07-14.08 derivatives" width="1427" height="538" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/perpetual-futuresspot-volume-ratio-1.07-14.08.png 1427w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/perpetual-futuresspot-volume-ratio-1.07-14.08-300x113.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/perpetual-futuresspot-volume-ratio-1.07-14.08-1024x386.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/perpetual-futuresspot-volume-ratio-1.07-14.08-768x290.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1427px) 100vw, 1427px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-438495" class="wp-caption-text">Chart showing the perpetual futures/spot volume ratio from July 1 to Aug. 14, 2024 (Source: <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/pro/perpteual-spot-volume">CoinGlass</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">Such a high futures-to-spot volume ratio shows just how important derivatives are in price discovery and liquidity. High volumes, as we&#8217;ve seen over the past year, tend to lead to increased volatility and faster price movements. And with the majority of that volume on Binance, the volatility risk becomes even greater.</p>
<p class="p1">Perpetual futures funding rates have been consistently negative since Aug. 13, following a period of primarily positive rates earlier in the month. The significant volume in Bitcoin perpetual futures suggests high leverage in the market. Negative funding rates in the perpetual futures market indicate short-term bearish pressure. However, this could also set the stage for a potential short squeeze if buying pressure emerges from another rally.</p>
<figure id="attachment_438496" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-438496" style="width: 1427px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-438496" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bitcoin-funding-rate-1m.png" alt="bitcoin funding rate 1m" width="1427" height="329" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bitcoin-funding-rate-1m.png 1427w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bitcoin-funding-rate-1m-300x69.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bitcoin-funding-rate-1m-1024x236.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bitcoin-funding-rate-1m-768x177.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1427px) 100vw, 1427px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-438496" class="wp-caption-text">Chart showing the Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rate from Aug. 1 to Aug. 14, 2024 (Source: <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/pro/fr/BTC">CoinGlass</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">The slow recovery we&#8217;ve seen in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoins-crash-wipes-out-5-billion-in-futures-oi-but-options-remain-stable/">open interest</a> further confirms that the Bitcoin market is currently in a state of cautious recovery. While the price has rebounded from its recent low, derivatives data shows that traders are still uncertain about future direction.</p>
<p class="p1">The dominance of perpetual futures and the balanced long/short ratio point to a market that could experience significant volatility in the near term, as a large portion of highly sophisticated traders are preparing for the market to go both ways.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/funding-rate-turns-negative-as-bitcoin-drops-below-64k/">funding rate</a> for perpetual futures serves as a proxy for market sentiment and shows the balance between long and short positions. Significant deviations from the average funding rate across exchanges can signal <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/funding-rate-turns-negative-as-bitcoin-drops-below-64k/">potential imbalances</a> in positioning. A spike in the funding rate on a particular exchange shows a large number of long positions, which could lead to a potential squeeze or long liquidations if the market turns.</p>
<p>Another observation that can be made from the changes in funding rates is arbitrage opportunities. A significant divergence between exchanges or contract types enables traders to capitalize on temporary market inefficiencies. This is why even the slightest changes in funding rates can be important, as they can act as early warning signs of potential market shifts or changes in sentiment.</p>
<p>The funding rate for USDT and USD-margined perpetual futures has been relatively stable throughout May. This is indicative of a relatively stable market that&#8217;s leaning bullish. This stability was briefly broken on May 27, when the funding rate for USDT and USD-margined perpetual futures on dYdX spiked to 0.0889%. This was a sharp deviation from the average rate of around 0.0120% across other exchanges, indicating a significant imbalance between long and short positions. More traders taking on long positions could have resulted from Bitcoin&#8217;s brief price spike to over $70,000. However, as other exchanges saw less volatility in their funding rate, there could have been a particular inefficiency that dYdX traders were rushing to exploit.</p>

<p>The funding rate for token-margined perpetual futures has experienced similar stability in the past 30 days, hovering between 0.0100% and 0.0140% throughout May. In the early hours of June 4, Bitmex saw a significant drop in funding rate for token-margined perpetual futures from a stable 0.0100% to -0.0352%. Such a sharp drop in 24 hours showed a robust bearish sentiment among traders. However, with other exchanges seeing their rates stable at 0.0100%, the bearish sentiment seems to be concentrated among Bitmex users alone. Bitmex&#8217;s morning funding rate was close to the lower limit of -0.0375% set by many exchanges, which showed extreme positioning in these contracts compared to USDT or USD-margined contracts.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, the funding rate managed to consolidate at around -0.0150%, further showing the volatility&#8217;s short-lived nature.</p>
<figure id="attachment_423622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-423622" style="width: 2420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-423622" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/funding-rate-for-token-margined-perpetual-futures-30d.png" alt="funding rate for token margined perpetual futures 30d" width="2420" height="480" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/funding-rate-for-token-margined-perpetual-futures-30d.png 2420w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/funding-rate-for-token-margined-perpetual-futures-30d-300x60.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/funding-rate-for-token-margined-perpetual-futures-30d-1024x203.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/funding-rate-for-token-margined-perpetual-futures-30d-768x152.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/funding-rate-for-token-margined-perpetual-futures-30d-1536x305.png 1536w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/funding-rate-for-token-margined-perpetual-futures-30d-2048x406.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2420px) 100vw, 2420px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-423622" class="wp-caption-text">Chart showing the funding rate for token-margined perpetual futures from May 3 to the early hours of June 4, 2024 (Source: <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate">CoinGlass</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some of this volatility could be attributed to the speculative nature of token-margined contracts. Exchanges offering token-margined perpetual futures often provide higher leverage than USDT or USD-margined contracts. While higher leverage can amplify potential gains, it also magnifies losses, making token-margined contracts riskier and more suitable for speculative trading strategies.</p>
<p>Token-margined perpetual futures tend to attract a higher proportion of retail traders and speculators who are more risk-tolerant and may seek higher returns. Institutional investors and professional traders, who typically prioritize risk management and capital preservation, are more likely to gravitate towards USDT or USD-margined contracts, which are perceived as more stable.</p>
<p>Another important factor that could have led to such a sharp drop in the funding rate on Bitmex is market depth. Token-margined perpetual futures usually have lower liquidity than their USDT or USD-margined counterparts. Lower liquidity leads to wider bid-ask spreads, making these markets more susceptible to speculation and volatility.</p>
<p>The stable rates across most exchanges over the past 30 days, combined with <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&#8217;s</a> relatively range-bound price action, indicate a period of market uncertainty and indecision. Therefore, the isolated drops and spikes in funding rates on specific exchanges in the past weeks indicate internal trends and changes more than market-wide ones.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/coinbase/">Coinbase&#8217;s</a> non-US exchange saw over $1 billion in daily trading volume on <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1760003662771040536">Feb. 20</a>.</p>
<p>Coinbase International Exchange wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the last 24 hours [our] perpetual futures surpassed $1 billion in notional contract volume traded.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase CEO <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/brian-armstrong/">Brian Armstrong</a> commented that it was the &#8220;first time&#8221; the non-US unit surpassed the $1 billion daily volume mark and noted that the service &#8220;continues to grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Live data indicates that, as of 8:15 pm UTC, Coinbase International Exchange saw $1.098 billion in 24-hour perpetual trading volume.</p>
<p>The amount includes an Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) perpetual trading volume of $557.5 million, Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) perpetual trading volume of $425.9 million, and Solana (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">SOL</a>) perpetual trading volume of $50.6 million. Other listings have considerably lower trading volumes.</p>
<p>Coinbase International Exchange additionally hosts a spot market, which saw $12.4 million in 24-hour spot trading volume. Only Bitcoin and Ethereum are available for spot trading as of Feb. 20.</p>
<p>The above data is separate from the company&#8217;s main US exchange at Coinbase.com, which reported $3.2 billion in spot trading volume on Feb. 20.</p>
<h2>Derivatives trading</h2>
<p>Coinbase launched its international exchange with a focus on institutional perpetual trading in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-launch-international-exchange-for-institutional-traders-outside-us/">May 2023</a>. The company further extended the exchange&#8217;s offerings to include <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-international-launches-spot-bitcoin-and-ethereum-trading-for-non-us-clients/">spot trading</a> in December. According to its website, the international exchange does not allow retail trading for now.</p>
<p>News of rising volumes comes days after Coinbase <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-saw-3-1-billion-of-revenue-in-2023-with-one-third-of-that-total-in-q4/">reported earnings</a> for its main, US-based exchange. Though the firm did not report finances for its international exchange, it commented on the market in general, noting that crypto derivatives market made up 75% of all trading volume in 2023.</p>
<p>Coinbase added that the derivatives market is largely unregulated, and there is an opportunity for it to act as a trusted and regulated service provider in this domain.</p>
<p>The exchange further noted that it began to launch derivatives for eligible US retail traders through a subsidiary, Coinbase Financial Markets (CFM), in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-to-offer-regulated-crypto-futures-to-us-customers-amid-ongoing-regulatory-battle/">late 2023</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The crypto market is currently charged with tension, anticipating the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s impending decision on the first spot Bitcoin ETF. Amidst divided opinions over whether the SEC will <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-etf-decision-may-be-imminent-as-grayscale-files-exchange-registration-form-bloomberg-analyst/">approve</a> the ETF in the coming days or <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-expected-by-just-39-of-financial-advisors-this-year-bitwise-survey/">postpone</a> the decision again, a close analysis of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/deribit/">Deribit&#8217;s</a> Bitcoin options market reveals traders bracing for considerable price movements in January.</p>
<p class="p1">As of Jan. 5, the total open interest in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> options on Deribit is 228,646.70 BTC, representing a notional value of $10.05 billion. This substantial figure indicates a high level of market participation and interest in Bitcoin&#8217;s future price movements.</p>
<p class="p1">The dominance of call open interest, comprising 162,694.50 BTC compared to put open interest at 65,952.20 BTC, suggests a bullish sentiment among investors. They appear to be anticipating or hedging against a potential increase in Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p class="p1">The breakdown of open interest by strike price further reinforces this bullish sentiment. The highest concentration of call options is at the $50,000 strike price, with a value of $1.05 billion. This level could be viewed as a significant psychological and financial threshold that many investors are betting Bitcoin will reach or surpass. The next highest concentration is at the $45,000 and $60,000 strike prices, indicating optimism for even higher prices, though with lesser conviction than for the $50,000 mark.</p>

<p class="p1">Regarding open interest by expiration, the data shows a heavy concentration of call options for the Jan. 26 expiration, with $2.21 billion in calls versus $988.49 million in puts. This suggests that the bullish sentiment is more pronounced for the medium term, with a large part of the market anticipating significant developments surrounding the Bitcoin ETF to occur before this date.</p>
<figure id="attachment_386846" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-386846" style="width: 2400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-386846" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bitcoin-open-interest-by-expiration.png" alt="bitcoin options open interest by expiration date" width="2400" height="1200" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bitcoin-open-interest-by-expiration.png 2400w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bitcoin-open-interest-by-expiration-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bitcoin-open-interest-by-expiration-1024x512.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bitcoin-open-interest-by-expiration-768x384.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bitcoin-open-interest-by-expiration-1536x768.png 1536w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/bitcoin-open-interest-by-expiration-2048x1024.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-386846" class="wp-caption-text">Graph showing the open interest on Bitcoin options by expiration date on Jan. 5 (Source: <a href="https://metrics.deribit.com/options/BTC">Deribit</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">The regular trade breakdown, showing almost equal percentages of puts and calls bought and sold —17.8% and 17.9% for puts, 32.1% and 32.2% for calls, respectively —<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>indicates a balanced market in terms of trading activities. The data shows that a higher percentage of market participants are engaged in call option transactions compared to puts. This indicates a stronger interest in betting on or hedging against an increase in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. The balance between calls bought and sold is also nearly equal, suggesting that for every investor speculating on a price rise (by buying calls), there is almost an equal number of investors (or perhaps the same investors in different transactions) who are either more cautious or looking to profit from selling these options.</p>
<figure id="attachment_386847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-386847" style="width: 2400px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-386847" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/regular-trade-breakdown-bitcoin-options.png" alt="regular trade breakdown bitcoin options" width="2400" height="1200" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/regular-trade-breakdown-bitcoin-options.png 2400w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/regular-trade-breakdown-bitcoin-options-300x150.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/regular-trade-breakdown-bitcoin-options-1024x512.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/regular-trade-breakdown-bitcoin-options-768x384.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/regular-trade-breakdown-bitcoin-options-1536x768.png 1536w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/regular-trade-breakdown-bitcoin-options-2048x1024.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-386847" class="wp-caption-text">Graph showing the regular trade breakdown for Deribit options on Jan. 5 (Source: <a href="https://metrics.deribit.com/options/BTC">Deribit</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p1">Data from Deribit reflects a predominantly bullish sentiment, with investors showing a strong belief in the potential for Bitcoin&#8217;s price to increase, particularly towards the $50,000 level in the short to medium term. However, a substantial amount of put options and balanced trade activities indicate a cautious approach among traders, with many preparing for further volatility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchuna questioned the veracity of a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoins-price-risk-slumping-to-36k-if-sec-denies-etf-applications-matrixport-warns/">Matrixport report</a> that claimed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might reject several pending applications for a spot <a href="http://cryptoslate.com/etf">Bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">At this point, saying SEC rejecting it isn’t just going against </span><span class="r-18u37iz">James Seyffart </span>and I like it was in the early days, now you basically saying multiple mainstream news reporters with multiple sources on inside of this also have it wrong too. Not saying it’s impossible (again we are still ‘only’ at 90%) but it overturns a LOT of good intel,&#8221; Balchunas <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1742539265001640227?s=20">said</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Balchunas furthered that no concrete information supported the speculated denials and questioned the basis of the prediction. The analyst wondered if the claim was based on information from insider sources within the applicants, the SEC, or if they were purely the personal opinion of Markus Thielen, the head of research at Matrixport.</p>
<p>Earlier today, digital asset management Matrixport said it <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoins-price-risk-slumping-to-36k-if-sec-denies-etf-applications-matrixport-warns/">anticipates </a>a likely rejection of pending ETF applications from the financial regulator for several reasons, including the SEC&#8217;s chair Gary Gensler&#8217;s anti-crypto posture.</p>

<h2>Long traders lose over $500M</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, news of a possible SEC rejection for the ETF applications caused a sharp decline in BTC&#8217;s price, as traders betting on further price increases lost over $500 million within four hours, according to CoinGlass <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData">data</a>.</p>
<p>During the period, BTC&#8217;s price suddenly crashed to as low as $41,500 after soaring above $45,000. The flagship asset price has slightly recovered to $43,289 as of press time.</p>
<p><em>CryptoSlate</em> Insight <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-loses-ground-plunges-below-42000-amidst-470-million-market-liquidation/">noted</a> that the steep losses suggested a bullish sentiment among traders, who unexpectedly found themselves bearing the brunt of BTC&#8217;s sudden price downturn.</p>
<p>Traders speculating on Bitcoin price contributed to around $160 million of these losses, followed by speculators on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> price who lost nearly $110 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase International Exchange said on <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseIntExch/status/1740411468632519143">Dec. 28</a> that it has set leverage limits to 10X on its various perpetual future contracts.</p>
<p>The company said in a post on X:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">&#8220;Did you hear? We upgraded our leverage to 10x on all perpetual futures contracts, empowering you to execute more efficient trading strategies.&#8221; </span></p></blockquote>
<p>In an attached help page, Coinbase International explained that users can continue to transact once they reach the 10X limit, but that new transactions are only permitted at leverage rates set out in its Default Initial Margin (DIM) rules.</p>
<p>In addition to the 10X cap, the company has set a maximum notional value limit of $90,000 that applies across all positions belonging to an Ultimate Beneficial Owner (UBO). Individual positions involving Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>), Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>), and 13 other assets also have specific limits measured in the cryptocurrency itself.</p>
<p>Coinbase International noted on the same page it reviews limits frequently. It said that it may offer higher limits as its activity increases.</p>
<h2>What are perpetual futures?</h2>
<p>Perpetual futures are a type of derivatives contract through which traders can speculate on the futures price without a definite expiration date.</p>
<p>This type of investment is generally considered high-risk due to the possibility of maximized losses as well as gains through leverage. Coinbase acknowledged those risks, writing that the level of risk involved &#8220;<span class="css-1qaijid r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">may not be suitable for all investors.</span>&#8221; It urged investors to consider their aims, risk appetite, and experience.</p>
<p>Coinbase International is the international trading arm of Coinbase. The platform launched in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-launch-international-exchange-for-institutional-traders-outside-us/">May 2023</a> with an initial focus on providing perpetual futures trading to institutional investors. It extended perpetual futures trading to retail investors in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-approved-to-offer-perpetual-futures-trading-to-non-u-s-residents-by-bermuda-monetary-authority/">September</a> and also added spot trading in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-international-launches-spot-bitcoin-and-ethereum-trading-for-non-us-clients/">December</a>.</p>
<p>The company is regulated under the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) and is only available to customers in some countries outside the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cboe Digital said on <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cboe-digital-to-launch-margined-bitcoin-and-ether-futures-on-january-11-2024-backed-by-crypto-and-traditional-finance-players-301986086.html">Nov. 13</a> that it will launch trading and clearing for margin futures on both <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> (ETH) in the coming months.</p>
<p>The company noted that this model will allow investors to trade futures without posting complete collateral upfront. According to reports from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exchange-operator-cboe-gets-nod-launch-leveraged-crypto-derivative-products-2023-06-05/">Reuters</a> in June, the current trading model requires investors to post full collateral for the relevant futures contract.</p>
<p>Cboe Digital plans to offer financially settled margined contracts initially. However, it also committed to offering physically settled products — meaning that the buyer can receive cryptocurrency rather than traditional assets — if regulatory approval is granted.</p>
<p>The company said that it will introduce margined Bitcoin and Ethereum on Jan. 11, 2024, and noted that it could introduce other products over the course of the year.</p>
<p>Cboe Digital additionally noted that, with the introduction of the new product, it would become the first U.S.-regulated crypto native combined exchange and clearinghouse to offer both spot and leveraged derivatives trading on one platform.</p>
<p>Several other companies in the crypto and traditional financial industries will offer support, including B2C2, BlockFills, CQG, Cumberland DRW, Jump Trading Group, Marex, StoneX Financial, Talos, tastytrade, Trading Technologies and Wedbush.</p>
<h2>Cboe highly involved in crypto ETFs</h2>
<p>Cboe Digital is part of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/cboe-global-markets/">Cboe Global Markets</a>, which is active in numerous other efforts to bridge crypto and traditional investing. The company&#8217;s Cboe BZX Exchange is notably involved in proposed rule changes for <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/cboe-files-amended-spot-bitcoin-etf-applications-finalizes-surveillance-agreement-with-coinbase/">several pending spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, including those from Invesco, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, and ARK Invest.</p>
<p>Cboe BZX Exchange is also involved in some Bitcoin futures ETFs, Ethereum futures ETFs, and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/first-leveraged-bitcoin-futures-etf-opens-for-trading-on-cboe/">leveraged crypto futures ETFs</a> that are currently available.</p>
<p>However, Cboe isn&#8217;t the only major player in this field. <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/nasdaq/">Nasdaq</a> is also involved in certain proposals — specifically spot Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Valkyrie. NYSE Arca, meanwhile, is involved with Grayscale&#8217;s planned GBTC spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Over the past week, Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) &#8216;s price has witnessed a notable surge, sparking heightened activity in the cryptocurrency market. One area that offers unique insights into traders&#8217; sentiments and expectations about this price movement is the options market. We can gauge how traders are positioning themselves in anticipation of future price movements through metrics like open interest, volume, and strike prices.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Options</span> are financial derivatives that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (in this case, Bitcoin) at a predetermined price on or before a specific date.</p>
<p class="p2">Options come in two primary forms: call options, which give the holder the right to buy the underlying asset, and put options, which give the holder the right to sell the underlying asset.</p>
<p class="p2">Options open interest represents the total number of outstanding (not yet settled) option contracts in the market. A high OI indicates significant interest in a particular option, suggesting strong sentiment (either bullish or bearish) towards the underlying asset. It provides a sense of the total market exposure or commitment traders have.</p>
<p class="p2">The open interest on calls reached an all-time high of $10.86 billion on Oct. 25, growing from $7.58 billion on Oct. 18. During the same period, open interest on puts increased from $3.34 billion to $5.31 billion.</p>
<p class="p2">The bullish trend in Bitcoin&#8217;s price from Oct. 18 to Oct. 25 was accompanied by increased put and call open interests. This suggests that traders actively participated in the market, with a historically unprecedented bullish expectation and a healthy bearish hedge. This could be due to various reasons, such as anticipated news events and increased volatility, most likely about the upcoming Bitcoin ETF in the U.S.</p>
<figure id="attachment_368372" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-368372" style="width: 1800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-368372" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bitcoin-options-open-interest-put-call-ratio-2021-2023-1.png" alt="Bitcoin options open interest put call ratio 2021 2023" width="1800" height="1013" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bitcoin-options-open-interest-put-call-ratio-2021-2023-1.png 1800w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bitcoin-options-open-interest-put-call-ratio-2021-2023-1-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bitcoin-options-open-interest-put-call-ratio-2021-2023-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bitcoin-options-open-interest-put-call-ratio-2021-2023-1-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bitcoin-options-open-interest-put-call-ratio-2021-2023-1-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-368372" class="wp-caption-text">Graph showing the open interest on Bitcoin put and call options from Feb. 16, 2021, to Oct. 25, 2023 (Source: <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-options-putcall-oi?s=1613402972&amp;u=1698314460&amp;zoom=">Glassnode</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p2">The put/call ratio is used to gauge market sentiment as it shows the proportion of puts to calls. A ratio above 1 indicates bearish sentiment (more puts than calls), while a ratio below 1 indicates bullish sentiment (more calls than puts). The increase in the ratio from 0.425 to 0.489 between Oct. 15 and Oct. 25 suggests that while the market remained bullish (since the ratio is still below 1), there was a relative increase in bearish sentiment or hedging activity compared to bullish sentiment.</p>
<p class="p2">A similar increase was also seen in the options volume. While open interest represents the cumulative positions traders hold, the volume shows the <span class="s1">current activity</span> and liquidity in the market. A sudden spike in volume, especially when accompanied by significant price moves, can indicate strong sentiment and momentum.</p>
<p class="p2">From Oct. 18 to Oct. 25, the put/call ratio decreased from 0.538 to 0.475. This indicates a shift towards even more bullish sentiment over this period. The volume of both puts and calls increased significantly, but the call volume saw a more pronounced increase, reaching the largest in Bitcoin&#8217;s history, just like the call open interest. The record call volume on Oct. 25 suggests a particularly active and bullish day in the Bitcoin options market.</p>
<figure id="attachment_368376" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-368376" style="width: 1800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-368376" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bitcoin-options-putcall-volume-ratio-2021-2023.png" alt="bitcoin options put:call volume ratio 2021 2023" width="1800" height="1013" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bitcoin-options-putcall-volume-ratio-2021-2023.png 1800w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bitcoin-options-putcall-volume-ratio-2021-2023-300x169.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bitcoin-options-putcall-volume-ratio-2021-2023-1024x576.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bitcoin-options-putcall-volume-ratio-2021-2023-768x432.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bitcoin-options-putcall-volume-ratio-2021-2023-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-368376" class="wp-caption-text">Graph showing the volume of Bitcoin put and call options from Feb. 16, 2021, to Oct. 25, 2023 (Source: <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-options-putcall-volume?s=1613276008&amp;u=1698313069&amp;zoom=">Glassnode</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p2">The high open interest at the $40,000 strike price further supports this bullish sentiment. It indicates that many traders anticipate or hope that Bitcoin will reach or surpass $40,000 by the expiration date of these options. While the high open interest for the $40,000 strike price shows optimism, the increasing put/call ratio we discussed earlier suggests that traders are also hedging against potential downside risks. This means that while many are optimistic about Bitcoin reaching $40,000, they are also preparing for scenarios where it might not. This is evident in the spike of put options at strike prices below $27,000.</p>
<figure id="attachment_368370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-368370" style="width: 2338px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-368370" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-26-at-12.26.01.png" alt="bitcoin options open interest by strike price" width="2338" height="1038" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-26-at-12.26.01.png 2338w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-26-at-12.26.01-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-26-at-12.26.01-1024x455.png 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-26-at-12.26.01-768x341.png 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-26-at-12.26.01-1536x682.png 1536w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-26-at-12.26.01-2048x909.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2338px) 100vw, 2338px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-368370" class="wp-caption-text">Chart showing the options open interest and market value by strike price on Oct. 25, 2023 (Source: <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/pro/options/OIStrike">CoinGlass</a>)</figcaption></figure>
<p class="p2">The rise in both open interest and volume indicates that the options market for Bitcoin is becoming more active and liquid. It also shows a notable rise in interest from institutional and sophisticated traders, as most retail traders rarely stray from spot markets.</p>
