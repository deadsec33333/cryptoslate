										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solana-based memecoin launchpad <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/products/pump-fun/">Pump.Fun</a> experienced a sharp 33% decline in revenue this week after <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/pump-fun-disables-livestream-feature-amid-community-backlash-over-nsfw-launches/">disabling its live-streaming</a> feature.</p>
<p>According to DefiLlama data, the platform&#8217;s revenue fell from $5 million to $3.6 million in just one day, marking its most significant single-day drop since March.</p>
<p>The decision came after a series of controversial incidents that triggered widespread backlash.</p>
<h2>Growing criticism</h2>
<p>The platform&#8217;s issues began earlier this month when a middle-schooler reportedly celebrated earning $30,000 in a rug pull, a scheme in which creators abruptly sell large holdings, causing token values to collapse.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/solana-memecoins-turn-to-nsfw-content-as-pump-fun-livestreams-resemble-adult-webcam-site/">controversy escalated</a> on Nov. 28 when a user staged a fake suicide during a live stream to promote their memecoin. Following the incident, Pump.Fun shut down live streaming capabilities, leading to a noticeable decline in user activity and earnings.</p>
<p>Pump.Fun, which has generated nearly $230 million in revenue since its January launch, remains a contentious player in the memecoin space. While the platform initially thrived on its unconventional approach, the recent controversies have cast a shadow over its meteoric rise.</p>
<p>Analysts suggest the growing negative sentiment surrounding the platform could have lasting effects, which could be further exacerbated by user fatigue.</p>
<h2>Risks in memecoins</h2>
<p>The recent events have reignited concerns over the risks associated with the unregulated memecoin market, which often lacks safeguards to protect users from predatory practices and harmful content.</p>
<p>The platform&#8217;s live-streaming feature, once a draw for its viral potential, became a double-edged sword, amplifying both its popularity and its vulnerabilities. As Pump.Fun grapples with its image crisis; competitors on platforms like Base seem poised to capitalize on the shifting tide.</p>
<p>Whether the platform can regain its footing in the volatile world of crypto remains uncertain, but the recent fallout illustrates the high stakes in the race to dominate the memecoin market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/">Tether Limited</a> reported <a href="https://tether.io/news/tether-hits-7-7-billion-2024-nine-month-profits-102-5-billion-in-u-s-treasury-holdings-almost-120-billion-usd%e2%82%ae-circulation-and-an-over-6-billion-reserve-buffer-in-q3-2024-attestation/">$2.5 billion</a> in net profit for the third quarter, bringing its year-to-date profits to a record-breaking $7.7 billion.</span></p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s strong third-quarter numbers were primarily boosted by its gold holdings, which amount to roughly $5 billion, recording $1.1 billion in unrealized profit.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Tether&#8217;s latest assurance opinion, conducted by accounting firm BDO, the firm has raised its excess reserve buffer to over $6 billion, reflecting a 15% growth rate in the past nine months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the firm&#8217;s total equity is at an all-time high of $14.2 billion, consolidating its assets at $134.4 billion. Tether CEO <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/paolo-ardoino/">Paolo Ardoino</a> stated:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;By increasing our reserve buffer to over $6 billion and maintaining a focus on strategic investments, Tether is once again setting the standard for stability in the financial space.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>US treasuries and Bitcoin</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Tether&#8217;s issuing companies now hold over $105 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including a record $102.5 billion in US Treasuries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This amount places the crypto firm among the top 18 global holders of US Treasuries — above Germany, Australia, and the UAE — and is nearly $5 billion larger than Tether&#8217;s </span><strong><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/tethers-5-2-billion-h1-profit-sets-new-high-as-us-treasury-holdings-surpass-germany/">last attestation report</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the company added 7,100 Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) to its stash, currently valued at nearly $4.8 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm’s stablecoin, Tether USD (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tether/">USDT</a>), surged to a circulation of nearly $120 billion, marking a 30% increase year-to-date. This is a new all-time high in USDT supply and translates to an additional $27.8 billion in issuance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ardoino added:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Reaching the $120 billion USD₮ milestone and reporting $102.5 billion in U.S. Treasury exposure highlights the company’s unparalleled financial strength.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond its reserves, Tether&#8217;s investment arm has expanded its proprietary portfolio to $7.7 billion, channeling funds into renewable energy, Bitcoin mining, artificial intelligence, telecommunications, and education sectors. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/riot-platforms/">Riot Platforms</a> CEO Jason Les revealed substantial interest from &#8220;blue-chip&#8221; companies looking to partner with the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> miner on AI and high-performance computing (HPC) initiatives.</p>
<p>Speaking during the Oct. 30 earnings call, Les explained that the company has received numerous inbound offers to secure large-scale power capacity. The\ inquiries come from highly credible, financially stable organizations capable of committing to long-term agreements.</p>
<p>Les attributed the interest to Riot&#8217;s reputation and extensive energy capacity. He <a href="https://x.com/matthew_sigel/status/1851961542125785431">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Riot&#8217;s reputation and our image of having so much power capacity is what&#8217;s resulting in us getting these unsolicited offers for really significant amounts of power capacity. The interest that we&#8217;re seeing is for hundreds of megawatts, not necessarily smaller amounts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement corroborates an earlier interview where the CEO emphasized Riot&#8217;s readiness to consider AI ventures if it sees the right partnership and deal structure.</p>
<p>According to Les, Riot&#8217;s facilities — such as the 750-megawatt Rockdale facility and the Corsicana mining site with a one-gigawatt capacity — offer strategic advantages that could help advance the company&#8217;s effort in the sector.</p>
<p>Riot&#8217;s interest in AI is unsurprising because the sector could provide a lucrative revenue stream for <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/post-halving-bitcoin-miners-are-choosing-between-hodling-btc-and-upgrading-to-ai/">Bitcoin miners</a> who allocate a portion of their energy capacity to it. One example is how <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/core-scientific/">Core Scientific</a> is expected to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/core-scientifics-ai-deal-fuels-8-7-billion-revenue-forecast-shares-rise/">earn more than $8 billion</a> over a 12-year period in a deal with AI Hyperscaler CoreWeave.</p>
<h2>Q3 losses</h2>
<p>A potential revenue boost from AI would be timely for Riot, which reported a widening year-over-year net loss for the third quarter despite a notable rise in revenue.</p>
<p>According to a press <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/riot-platforms-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-current-operational-and-financial-highlights-302291931.html">statement</a>, Riot posted a net loss of $154.4 million$0.54 per share, compared to a $80 million loss during the same period last year. This increased loss occurred alongside a 65% rise in total revenue to $80 million, fueled by higher Bitcoin prices and greater operational output.</p>
<p>Additionally, Riot&#8217;s average Bitcoin mining cost, excluding depreciation, was $35,376 per coin for the quarter. This increase was driven by a reduction in power credits—down 75% from Q3 2023—and a recent <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoins-price-evolution-post-halving-examining-five-distinct-epochs/">Bitcoin halving</a> event in April 2024, which cut block rewards by half.</p>
<p>Further, the global network hash rate saw a 59% rise, putting additional pressure on mining costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/microstrategy/">MicroStrategy</a> posted a net loss of <a href="https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltb564490bc5201f31/blt3f6e292a4eccb573/66abeaab2fce4524ac6ff4a1/microstrategy-q2-2024-earnings-presentation.pdf">$123 million</a> for the second quarter, an improvement from the $137 million loss in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>The company narrowed its quarterly losses on the back of lower impairment losses and a strategic increase in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> holdings, which now total 226,500 BTC.</p>
<p>Following the earnings announcement, MicroStrategy&#8217;s stock climbed 4.18% in after-hours trading as of press time, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/microstrategy-faces-scrutiny-over-cash-flow-and-bitcoin-holdings-ahead-of-q2-earning/">reflecting investor confidence</a> in the company&#8217;s strategic direction and financial performance​</p>
<p>The adjusted loss per share for the quarter was $7.62, slightly better than the previous quarter&#8217;s loss of $8.26 per share. Comparatively, the firm reported an EPS of $2.35 in the same quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Revenue for the second quarter was $111.4 million, below the consensus estimate of $122 million, and down from $115.2 million in the previous quarter and $120.4 million during the same period last year. Meanwhile, the firm reported a 21% year-over-year increase in subscription services revenues, totaling $24.1 million for the quarter.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy continued <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/microstrategys-786-million-bitcoin-buy-sees-share-value-climb-3/">expanding its Bitcoin portfolio</a> during the second quarter, acquiring 12,222 BTC at an average price of $65,882 each. The company further increased its holdings in July by acquiring an additional 169 BTC for $11.4 million.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s total holdings stand at 226,500 BTC, purchased for $8.3 billion at an average cost of $36,821 per Bitcoin as of July 31.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy introduced  &#8220;BTC Yield&#8221; as a new key performance indicator to measure the percentage change in the ratio of its Bitcoin holdings to its assumed diluted shares outstanding. Based on the metric, the firm achieved a BTC Yield of 12.2% year-to-date, with an annual target yield of 4-8% from 2025-2027.</p>
<p>The company also recently raised $800 million through a convertible senior notes offering and announced a <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/microstrategy-shares-are-up-5-pre-market-following-the-announcement-of-a-10-for-1-stock-split/">10-for-1 stock split</a> effective Aug. 7.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy continued to manage its equity capital closely, filing a registration statement for a new $2 billion at-the-market equity offering program.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy&#8217;s second-quarter results highlight the company&#8217;s efforts to balance its substantial Bitcoin holdings with the growth of its software business. The firm&#8217;s future performance will depend on navigating the volatility of the crypto market while advancing its business analytics services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> reported total revenue of <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Q2-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">$1.449 billion</a> for the second quarter, beating the market consensus estimate of $1.396 billion. Its total income for the same period last year was $674.1 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the exchange&#8217;s net income for the period was $36 million, compared to a net loss of $97 million in 2023. EPS for the three months ending June 30 stood at $0.14 per share.</p>
<p>The exchange also highlighted the significant progress in the adoption of its Layer-2 network Base, which saw transactions increase by 300% quarter-over-quarter.</p>
<p>Coinbase said its efforts during the second quarter have significantly improved network efficiency. Median daily fees per transaction dropped below 1 cent, making Base one of the cheapest L2s available.</p>
<p>Despite the overall positive revenue, total revenue saw an 11% decline quarter-over-quarter.</p>
<p>Transaction revenue fell 11%, amounting to $781 million during the quarter, while subscription and services revenue experienced a 17% increase, reaching $599 million amid the company&#8217;s efforts to diversify revenues.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> played a significant role in Coinbase&#8217;s trading volumes, representing 35% of trading volumes and 31% of transaction revenues in the second quarter. However, total trading volumes decreased by 28% quarter-over-quarter, with consumer trading volume declining by 34% and institutional trading volume dropping by 26%.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Coinbase anticipates third-quarter subscription and services revenue to be between $530 million and $600 million.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s outlook reflects several factors, including a 3% decline in the average price of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> in July, expectations of a September rate cut, increased expenses related to the adoption of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/usd-coin/">USDC</a> as a compliant stablecoin, and a one-time $8 million blockchain rewards revenue benefit recorded in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Coinbase also expects headwinds related to fluctuating crypto prices and additional expenses aimed at driving the global adoption of USDC.</p>
<p>The exchange&#8217;s shares have risen approximately 20% year-to-date. Following the earnings report, the stock was up 1.43% in after-hours trading, priced at $216 per share as of press time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/microstrategy/">MicroStrategy</a>, a prominent <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> holder, faces scrutiny regarding its cash flows ahead of its earnings report.</p>
<p>On July 31, Michael Saylor, a prominent Bitcoin advocate, <a href="https://x.com/saylor/status/1818686538890592285">announced</a> that the company would release its earnings on Aug. 1 after market close and host a live webinar to discuss the results.</p>
<h2>Cash flow concerns</h2>
<p>Bloomberg reported that MicroStrategy&#8217;s software business is drawing increased attention as its performance could become more crucial for its cash flow.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s software business revenue is expected to show minimal change from the last quarter. This stagnation is concerning, primarily because the firm has <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/microstrategy-ups-convertible-note-offering-to-700m/">relied on convertible notes</a> extensively to acquire much of its Bitcoin this year.</p>
<p>TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza emphasized that managing cash flow is critical for covering interest on the company&#8217;s convertible debt. He noted that the firm must ensure its cash flows can handle the added interest expense from this debt.</p>
<p>The company expects around $45 million in interest expenses and $20 million in cash taxes this year. Meanwhile, Vitanza estimates its earnings before items like taxes to be approximately $82 million.</p>
<p>Another development that could affect the firm&#8217;s cash flow is the upcoming accounting changes slated for next year. MicroStrategy will need to value its digital assets at market rates and might face a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax if its average annual adjusted income exceeds $1 billion over a three-year period.</p>
<p>Notably, the company has acknowledged that these changes could significantly affect its financial results, including earnings and cash flow.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, analysts pointed out that MicroStrategy has options to manage its financial obligations, as its debt is not due until 2027 or later. So, the company could issue new convertible debt, secure a loan, issue additional shares, or even divest some of its Bitcoin holdings to generate funds.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ownership concerns</h2>
<p>Besides the cash flow concerns, MicroStrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin ownership has also been questioned. The Michael Saylor-led company has <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/microstrategys-786-million-bitcoin-buy-sees-share-value-climb-3/">grown its stash</a> to over 200,000 BTC, valued at nearly $15 billion, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder.</p>
<p>However, Seeking Alpha analyst Michael Del Monte pointed out that most of MicroStrategy&#8217;s Bitcoin is held by MacroStrategy, a separate entity. This separation means MicroStrategy shareholders do not have direct claims on the Bitcoin held by MacroStrategy.</p>
<p>Del Monte also noted that the firm&#8217;s shelf equity offerings approach to acquiring Bitcoin might dilute shareholder value. He suggested that MicroStrategy was acting as a capital-raising vehicle to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/microstrategy-bought-7-8-million-of-bitcoin-since-january-now-holds-214400-btc/">boost Bitcoin holdings</a> at MacroStrategy, leading to equity dilution and debt without direct benefits from the Bitcoin assets.</p>
<p>Conversely, Baris Serifsoy, former Managing Director at UBS, refuted Del Monte&#8217;s concerns, saying he is more focused on MicroStrategy&#8217;s ability to monetize its Bitcoin position and transition efficiently to a cloud-based SaaS provider.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://x.com/BSerifsoy/status/1818667898115674347">remarked</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is a theoretical risk. It would only become relevant if the operating cash-flow cannot meet the debt service AND Microstrategy cannot roll over the debt anymore AND Macrostrategy are unwilling / unable (low btc price) to sell coins to redeem the debt of the mothership.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/galaxy-digital/">Galaxy Digital</a> reported a net loss of <a href="https://investor.galaxy.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx">$177 million</a> for the second quarter, compared to a net profit of $1.6 million during the same period last year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the firm&#8217;s net revenue for the second quarter stood at $53.7 million, down from $108.7 million in the same quarter last year.</p>
<p>The firm largely attributed the loss to downturns in the crypto market during the period. It faced significant challenges with net losses on digital assets and investments, marking a sharp contrast to its previous financial performance.</p>
<p>Despite the overall net loss, Galaxy managed to generate revenue across its various business segments, including Global Markets, Asset Management, and Digital Infrastructure Solutions. The company continues to focus on strategic initiatives to drive future growth and stabilize its financial performance amid market volatility.</p>
<h2>Q2 results</h2>
<p>Galaxy Digital&#8217;s equity capital stood at $2.1 billion as of June 30, reflecting a 3% decrease from the previous quarter. The company&#8217;s liquidity position also weakened, dropping 11% to $1.33 billion.</p>
<p>Despite these declines, Galaxy managed to boost its cash and net stablecoins by 150% to $409 million, demonstrating a robust cash management strategy amid market volatility.</p>
<p>The firm recorded a dramatic increase in assets under stake (AUS), which surged to $3.3 billion by July 18 — up from $486 million at the end of March. The growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of CryptoManufaktur, a blockchain node operator.</p>
<p>Galaxy Global Markets experienced a significant drop in counterparty trading revenue, which fell to $24 million in Q2 2024, a 64% decline from the previous quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower trading volumes and adverse asset price movements.</p>
<p>Despite the decline, the trading business managed to generate approximately $90 million in revenue year-to-date through June, representing a nearly 80% increase compared to the first half of 2023.</p>
<p>Galaxy Asset Management (GAM) reported a decrease in assets under management (AUM), which dropped by 42% to $4.6 billion. Management and performance fees also fell by 19% to $14.5 million.</p>
<p>These declines were mainly due to the liquidation of assets associated with the FTX estate and general market depreciation. Nonetheless, GAM announced the launch of the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF in collaboration with Invesco, a strategic move to enhance its product offerings.</p>
<p>The Digital Infrastructure Solutions segment reported mining revenue of $24 million for the quarter, down 24% from the first quarter. This decline was primarily attributed to the Bitcoin halving in April.</p>
<p>Galaxy&#8217;s proprietary mining hashrate decreased by 5% to 2.9 EH/s. However, the segment experienced a 341% increase in assets under stake, reaching $2.1 billion by the end of June, highlighting Galaxy&#8217;s growing influence as a major validator on the Solana network.</p>
<h2>Outlook</h2>
<p>Galaxy Digital continues to advance its strategic initiatives, including a planned reorganization and domestication to become a Delaware-incorporated company.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company aims to list on Nasdaq, pending regulatory and shareholder approvals. It filed an amendment to its registration statement on July 26, which is currently under review by the SEC.</p>
<p>The reorganization and planned Nasdaq listing aim to align Galaxy Digital with regulatory standards and enhance its market positioning. The move is expected to attract more institutional investors and provide greater liquidity for the company&#8217;s shares.</p>
<p>Galaxy Digital said it remains optimistic about its future prospects despite the challenges faced in the second quarter. The company is focused on expanding its digital asset and blockchain infrastructure, as evidenced by the acquisition of CryptoManufaktur and collaborations with major financial institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> miner <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/riot-platforms/">Riot Platforms</a> reported a net loss of $84.4 million for the second quarter, compared to a net loss of $27.4 million during the same period last year.</p>
<p>Despite the financial setback, the company reported $70.0 million in revenue for the quarter, down slightly from $76.7 million in the prior year. The results reflect a challenging environment following the Bitcoin network&#8217;s recent &#8216;halving&#8217; event.</p>
<p>Riot Platforms&#8217; loss per share for the three months ending June 30 stood at $0.32.</p>
<h2>Q2 results</h2>
<p>The firm&#8217;s net loss was driven by a $76.4 million decrease in the fair value of Bitcoin, a non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $32.1 million, and depreciation and amortization of $37.3 million.</p>
<p>The miner also reported a 52% decline in Bitcoin production, which dropped to 844 Bitcoin from 1,775 in the second quarter of 2023. However, Riot Platforms managed to maintain strong gross margins despite the decline with revenue on par with the previous year.</p>
<p>The &#8216;halving&#8217; event and increased network difficulty contributed to a higher average direct cost to mine Bitcoin, which rose to $25,327 from $5,734 per Bitcoin in the second quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>The company reported $13.9 million in power credits for the quarter, including $4.4 million from demand response programs, which helped reduce its average energy cost.</p>
<p>Riot ended the second quarter with $646.5 million in working capital, including $481.2 million in cash on hand, and held 9,334 unencumbered Bitcoin, valued at approximately $585.0 million.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Riot Platforms anticipates achieving a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 36 EH/s by the end of 2024 and increasing its 2025 deployed hash rate guidance from 40 EH/s to 56 EH/s.</p>
<h2>Expansion</h2>
<p>Riot CEO Jason Les highlighted the company&#8217;s achievements, including the successful energization of its second large-scale facility in Corsicana, Texas. The facility added two buildings with a total capacity of 200 megawatts (MW), with the remaining two buildings expected to be operational by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Additionally, Riot expanded operations at its Rockdale Facility and nearly doubled its installed hash rate to 22 exahashes per second (EH/s) by the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>In July, Riot Platforms further strengthened its growth pipeline by acquiring Block Mining Inc., a vertically integrated Bitcoin miner in Kentucky. The acquisition brought 60 MW of power capacity across two facilities, with potential expansion to over 300 MW by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The company plans to leverage its strong balance sheet and experienced development teams to continue building best-in-class Bitcoin mining facilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/marathon-digital/">Marathon Digital Holdings</a> reported a record net income of $337.2 million in 2024&#8217;s first quarter.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s quarterly net income, published in its <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1357/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-first-quarter-2024-results">May 9</a> earnings report, represents 184% year-over-year growth from $118.7 million in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>EPS for the quarter stood at $1.26 per diluted share</p>
<p>The company reported record revenues of $165.2 million in the first quarter of 2024, representing 223% year-over-year growth from $51.1 million.</p>
<p>Marathon holds $1.6 billion in combined unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and Bitcoin as of March 31.</p>
<h2>Mining output</h2>
<p>Marathon also described increased Bitcoin output and infrastructure growth.</p>
<p>The company produced 2,811 BTC during the first quarter, worth $176 million at current market prices. In the first quarter of 2023, it produced 2,195 BTC, marking 28% year-over-year growth.</p>
<p>The company reported an energized hash rate of 27.8 exahashes per second (EH/s), up 142% from 11.5 EH/s in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>Marathon aims to achieve 50 EH/s, or 100% growth in hash rate, by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Marathon also closed several data center acquisitions, doubling its digital asset compute capacity to 1.1 gigawatts. More than half of the full amount exists on sites that the company directly owns or operates.</p>
<h2>Marathon enters S&amp;P rankings</h2>
<p>Marathon&#8217;s latest results come shortly after the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/as-marathon-digital-joins-sp-smallcap-600-shares-surge-18-percent/">addition to the S&amp;P SmallCap 600</a>. Marathon stock (MARA) gained 18% alongside the development on May 6.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s latest earnings report has not coincided with such a dramatic price change. MARA was down 2.19% on May 9 but up 1.22% after hours following its earnings release.</p>
<p>Despite minor losses, Marathon Digital Holdings remains the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining firm, with a market cap of $5.36 billion.</p>
<p>Marathon&#8217;s competitors have also published recent reports. Core Scientific reported $210.7 million in net income and 2,825 BTC mined in the first quarter on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/core-scientific-reports-210-7-million-in-q1-net-income-2825-btc-production/">May 9</a>.

<p>The company&#8217;s first-quarter BTC is worth $172.5 million at current prices.</p>
<p>The firm reported a hash rate of 25.5 exahashes per second (EH/s). The total hash rate includes 19.3 EH/s for self-mining, through which the company produces its own Bitcoin, plus 6.2 EH/s for hosting, through which it produces Bitcoin for its customers.</p>

<h2>Additional revenue stream</h2>
<p>Core Scientific is also exploring alternative revenue streams.</p>
<p>CEO Adam Sullivan said the firm is discussing with customers the conversion of over 500 megawatts to high-performance computing. By combining computing and Bitcoin mining, the firm will be active in &#8220;two very attractive markets,&#8221; Sullivan said.</p>
<p>A separate Financial Post report <a href="https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/bitcoin-miner-core-converts-data-center-infrastructure-for-ai">indicates</a> that the company plans for its high-performance computing business to cater to artificial intelligence (AI) firms.</p>
<p>The conversion of the 500 megawatts of infrastructure could take three to four years, but the company will generate revenue as it brings on clients.</p>
