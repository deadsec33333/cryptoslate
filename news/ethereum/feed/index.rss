										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) historic rally above $100,000 hit a roadblock on Dec. 5 as the flagship crypto fell back into five-figure territory, leaving a trail of liquidations across the market.</p>
<p>BTC gave up almost all of the 24-hour gains that took it to a new all-time high of $103,679. It fell to a low of roughly $90,300 for the day before attempting a recovery.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was trading at $95,500 as of press time amid heavy volatility, based on <em>CryptoSlate</em> data.</p>
<h2>Liquidations</h2>
<p>Roughly $885.61 million in leveraged positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, impacting 202,956 traders worldwide. Bitcoin accounted for $540 million of the total liquidations, followed by Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) with $105.53 million.</p>
<p>Other altcoins also experienced substantial liquidations, including <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/xrp/">XRP</a> with $57.07 million, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/dogecoin/">DOGE</a> with $37.54 million, and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">Solana</a> with $29.28 million. A combined $92 million was liquidated across other cryptocurrencies, highlighting the broad impact of Bitcoin&#8217;s price movement.</p>
<p>Long traders, who bet on rising prices, bore the brunt of the impact, with $640.83 million in liquidated positions — 72.4% of the total.</p>
<p>Short positions, which bet on price declines, accounted for $244.78 million. The largest single liquidation occurred on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/okx/">OKX</a>, where an $18.63 million BTC-USDT swap was forcibly closed.</p>
<h2>High volatility</h2>
<p>Breaking down the data further, $284.43 million was liquidated in just one hour, of which $279.50 million were longs. Over the last 12 hours, $552.54 million in liquidations were recorded, including $482.81 million in longs and $69.72 million in shorts.</p>
<p>The four-hour liquidation figure stood at $428.42 million, reflecting heightened volatility during Bitcoin&#8217;s decline.</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s Note: The liquidation numbers may not be fully accurate due to extremely high volatility at the time the article was published.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York City Mayor Eric Adams slammed the criticism he faced after deciding to receive his first three paychecks in Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) back in early 2022.</span></p>
<p>He made the statement during a Dec. 3 <strong><a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/875-24/transcript-mayor-adams-holds-in-person-media-availability">press conference</a></strong>, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Remember y’all laughed at me when I first got my Bitcoin. Who&#8217;s laughing now? Go look at my Bitcoin now. You all mock me. You&#8217;re taking your first three paychecks in Bitcoin. What&#8217;s wrong with you? Now you wish you would have done it.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said people should not be afraid of Bitcoin and voiced his satisfaction with people willing to think outside the box on President-elect <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/donald-trump/">Donald Trump&#8217;s</a> administration, like <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, when asked about the return on his Bitcoin paycheck, Adams explained that the amount is on his annual Conflicts of Interest Board (COIB) report, where the mayor must disclose his investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to his</span> <strong><a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/coib/downloads/pdf2/publicdocs/elected-officials-ad/2023/adams-e-2023-ad-report.pdf">2023 COIB</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Adams holds between $5,000 and $54,999.99 in BTC, considering the market value at the close of the reporting year. Based on Bitcoin&#8217;s 130% climb to a high of $99,600, Adams could hold roughly $110,000 worth of BTC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a broader approach to innovation, the New York Mayor also spoke on artificial intelligence (AI), stating that people shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of AI. He said the innovation push is a racehorse that the US is holding back &#8220;out of fear of being canceled.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>New York has generally <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">taken a pro-crypto stance with some caveats. In January 2022, legislators <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/new-york-introduces-bill-to-legalize-crypto-payments-for-state-purposes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>introduced a bill</strong></a></span> to allow state entities to receive Bitcoin as payment. However, the bill did not encourage the use of BTC for commercial purposes.</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile<span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">, in June of the same year, the New York State Senate approved a bill </span>that could</span> <strong><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/new-york-senate-passes-bill-that-could-ban-crypto-mining/">ban Bitcoin mining</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, mining firm Greenidge</span> <strong><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-miner-greenidge-wins-legal-battle-to-keep-mining-in-new-york/">won a legal battle</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep its operations in New York following the state&#8217;s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) denial of a Title V Air Permit application.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Neon EVM announced a transformative <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">Solana</a>-native framework, unveiling a suite of features aimed at integrating <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>-based decentralized applications (dApps) with Solana&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>
<p>The new architecture, detailed in a comprehensive whitepaper published on Dec. 3, enables direct interaction between Solana wallets and Ethereum applications while leveraging Solana&#8217;s high-performance infrastructure.</p>
<p>The release introduces key capabilities such as Solana wallet compatibility for Ethereum transactions, an on-chain mempool for scalable execution, and intent-based operations allowing conditional transactions like automated token swaps.</p>
<p>With these innovations, users can sign Neon EVM transactions using Solana wallets, including <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/products/phantom/">Phantom</a>, Backpack, and Solflare — eliminating the need for separate Ethereum wallets. The update significantly simplifies wallet management while ensuring users retain full control of their assets.</p>
<p>Neon EVM Chief Commercial Officer Davide Menegaldo emphasized the importance of the update, calling it a milestone in cross-chain functionality.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This release unifies user experience and liquidity, providing a seamless bridge between Solana and Ethereum dApps.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that the forthcoming Software Development Kit (SDK) would allow developers to fully explore these capabilities, paving the way for broader adoption of Ethereum-based applications on Solana.</p>
<p>The whitepaper also highlights infrastructure enhancements such as Associated Neon Accounts, which simplify liquidity management by linking Solana public keys to EVM-compatible addresses, and Controlled Transaction Trees, enabling atomic and parallel execution for complex applications.</p>
<p>Additionally, the on-chain mempool facilitates efficient scheduling and execution of transactions, reducing costs and improving scalability. The integration is set to benefit both users and developers.</p>
<p>Solana users gain access to Ethereum&#8217;s robust dApp ecosystem without leaving the Solana environment, while developers can deploy Ethereum applications with minimal friction by leveraging the network&#8217;s speed and efficiency. For DeFi platforms, the enhanced liquidity and reduced transaction costs could drive greater efficiency and adoption.</p>
<p>Neon EVM&#8217;s advancements mark a significant step in cross-chain collaboration, bridging two of the most dynamic blockchain ecosystems. By addressing challenges in interoperability and usability, the platform is poised to redefine how Ethereum-native applications interact with Solana&#8217;s infrastructure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital asset investment products experienced their second-lowest weekly inflows in the past eight weeks, totaling $270 million, according to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/coinshares/">CoinShares</a>&#8216; latest fund flow <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-211-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-2b8c701cfe06">report</a>. This brings the total year-to-date inflow to $37.3 billion.</p>
<p>James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, highlighted an unusual contrast in the flows across different assets within the class. He noted that the minimal inflow was partly due to the impact of newly launched options on products.</p>
<p>Despite their high initial volumes, options on US ETFs have not driven a comparable rise in ETP volumes, which dropped from $34 billion the previous week to $22 billion.</p>
<h2>Ethereum, XRP outperforms Bitcoin.</h2>
<p>While <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has been the market&#8217;s standout performer over the past year, large-cap alternative digital currencies like <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> and XRP outperformed the flagship digital asset last week.</p>
<p>According to the CoinShares report, Bitcoin faced its first significant outflow since early September, with $457 million flowing out. This outflow likely reflects profit-taking amid <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-predicted-to-hit-100k-by-inauguration-day-amid-record-pre-market-equities-trading/">Bitcoin&#8217;s recent rally toward $100,000.</a></p>
<p>In contrast, Ethereum has experienced a strong turnaround, attracting $634 million in inflows. This boosted its year-to-date inflow to $2.2 billion, surpassing the $2 billion it received in 2021.</p>
<p>XRP also saw a record inflow of $95 million, driven by growing optimism around the asset and expectations of a potential <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/wisdomtree-joins-race-for-spot-xrp-etf-as-4th-filing-amid-impending-sec-leadership-change/">XRP ETF launch in the US</a>. Notably, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/xrp-flips-solana-market-cap-soars-to-seven-year-high-fueled-by-south-korean-traders/">XRP&#8217;s price reached a seven-year high</a> after it surpassed $2, and its market capitalization hit a new peak of over $150 billion.</p>
<h2>US, Hong Kong lead flows.</h2>
<p>Regionally, the US led with $266 million in inflows, followed by Germany with $12.3 million. Switzerland and Canada experienced small outflows totaling $26 million and $10 million, respectively.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, crypto ETPs saw a notable $39 million in inflows, driven by the strong performance of Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>According to SoSo Value <a href="https://sosovalue.com/assets/etf/hk-btc-spot">data</a>, the three Hong Kong Bitcoin spot ETFs are nearing $500 million in net assets. The ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF leads with $277.48 million, followed by the Bosera Hashkey Bitcoin ETF with $153 million. The Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF holds around $40 million in assets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto industry experienced its second-lowest monthly losses this month, November 2024, with $71 million lost across 26 incidents, according to blockchain security firm Immunefi.</p>
<p>This marked a significant improvement compared to November 2023, which recorded $343 million in losses, representing a 79% year-over-year drop and a 4% decrease month-over-month.</p>
<p>Year-to-date (YTD) figures show the industry lost $1.48 billion in 2024 due to hacks and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/glossary/rug-pull/">rug pulls</a> in 209 incidents. This represents a 15% decline compared to the $1.7 billion lost during the same period in 2023.</p>
<h2>November hacks</h2>
<p>According to Immunefi, two incidents accounted for most of November&#8217;s losses. DeFi project Thala Labs lost $25.5 million, while the memecoins trading terminal DEXX suffered a $21 million loss.</p>
<p>The firm noted that all reported cases for the month involved DeFi platforms, which surpassed centralized finance (CeFi) as the primary target. DeFi incidents accounted for 100% of the lost funds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, hacks remained the leading cause of losses, with $70.99 million lost across 24 hacking incidents. Rug pulls contributed a smaller amount, with $25,300 lost in two cases.</p>
<p>Across chains, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/binance/">Binance</a>-backed BNB Chain was the most targeted blockchain, responsible for nearly 47% of the total losses across all chains. It added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> experienced 9 incidents, representing 30% of the total. Solana, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Aptos each experienced one incident, accounting for 3.3%, respectively.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>CEXs dominate 50% of 2024 crypto losses</h2>
<p>Centralized exchanges (CEXs) have emerged as a significant target in 2024, accounting for almost 50% of total crypto-related losses year-to-date. Immunefi <a href="https://x.com/immunefi/status/1862136361148621295">reported</a> that CEX-related losses totaled $724 million, marking the highest share of attacks on centralized platforms since 2021.</p>
<p>The resurgence in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/north-korea-linked-hack-costs-crypto-exchange-bingx-52-million-in-crypto-assets/">CEX vulnerabilities</a> became particularly evident during the third quarter of the year when 72% of crypto losses stemmed from <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/uaes-m2-crypto-exchange-hacked-for-13-7m-assures-full-fund-recovery/">CeFi hacks</a>. For context, a single attack on Indian exchange WazirX in July resulted in a<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/hacker-nearly-completes-laundering-230-million-stolen-from-wazirx/"> $235 million loss</a>.</p>
<p>Immunefi highlighted that CeFi&#8217;s vulnerabilities often stem from compromised hot wallets, allowing attackers to drain substantial funds. The $724 million lost by CEXs in 2024 came from just nine incidents, whereas a similar amount in DeFi was spread across 200 attacks.</p>
<p>The security firm pointed out that blackhat hackers have adopted innovative methods to exploit centralized platforms.</p>
<p>These techniques include impersonating recruiters or securing fake job placements to infiltrate internal teams and infrastructure. Such threats often go undetected until significant damage occurs, underscoring their growing sophistication.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His wallet still holds 106,006 ETH.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/cryptoquant/">CryptoQuant&#8217;s</a> community analyst Maartunn <a href="https://x.com/JA_Maartun/status/1862160599007756512">highlighted</a> that this is the fourth time Wilcke has transferred ETH to Kraken this year, surpassing $147 million. He first moved 4,300 ETH to the exchange on Feb. 10, worth $10.6 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilcke moved 10,000 ETH to Kraken four days later, worth $27.2 million. His third deposit of 10,000 ETH, equivalent to $37 million, occurred on May 22.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Community scrutiny</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum Foundation (EF) and Ethereum co-founders have been under community scrutiny this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Aug. 23, the EF moved 35,000 ETH to Kraken, which</span> <strong><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-foundation-reveals-spending-after-speculation-over-massive-transfer/">sparked concerns</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the community given the high value of the transaction — worth $94 million at the time of the transfer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EF contributor Josh Spark and Ethereum co-founder <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/vitalik-buterin/">Vitalik Buterin</a> clarified the reason behind the transfer, explaining that it was to foster institutions that boost Ethereum&#8217;s ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the on-chain data platform <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/arkham-intelligence/">Arkham</a>, the EF-related addresses saw nearly</span> <strong><a href="https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/ethereum-foundation">45,000 ETH in negative net flows</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One week later, Buterin</span> <strong><a href="https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1829801352500801538">had to explain</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a deposit in ETH equivalent to $10 million, citing that he had never realized profits for self-gain since 2018. He added:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;All sales have been to support various projects that I think are valuable, either within the ethereum ecosystem or broader charity (eg. biomedical R&amp;D).&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Nov. 28, Buterin-related wallets register a year-to-date negative net flow of 6,000 ETH.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ETH investors are especially worried by these transfers, given the crypto&#8217;s underperformance this year compared to Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) and Solana (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">SOL</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span> <strong><a href="https://app.artemis.xyz/home">data</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Artemis, Bitcoin and Solana have recorded close to 116% yearly returns in 2024, while ETH is up 51.5% so far, well below the crypto market&#8217;s average return of 109%.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum&#8217;s</a> DeFi sector is experiencing a revival, fueled by renewed market enthusiasm following Donald Trump&#8217;s election victory.</p>
<p>The total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum&#8217;s DeFi ecosystem has surged past $80 billion, marking its highest level in over two years.</p>
<p>These numbers come as key players like Aave and Uniswap have also achieved significant milestones during this bullish wave. Their rising activity highlights the increasing appeal of DeFi solutions as investors and users flock to platforms that offer innovative financial tools and opportunities.</p>
<h2>Record volume</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/products/uniswap/">Uniswap</a> has set a new record for monthly trading volume on Ethereum layer-2 networks, reaching $38 billion in November — a 50% jump from October&#8217;s $20.32 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://dune.com/queries/3553382/5979769">Data</a> from Dune Analytics reveals that Arbitrum contributed the lion&#8217;s share with $19.5 billion. It is followed by Base with $9.19 billion and Polygon at $4.33 billion.</p>
<p>In a Nov. 27 social media post, Uniswap Labs, the development team behind the platform, <a href="https://x.com/Uniswap/status/1861799456493953143" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Onchain history is being made. New all-time high for monthly L2 volume on the Uniswap Protocol.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, this achievement coincides with a significant rise in the price of Uniswap&#8217;s native <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/uniswap/">UNI</a> token. According to CryptoSlate&#8217;s data, the digital asset was up 10% over the last 24 hours, pushing its price to $12.84.</p>
<p>Adding to the excitement, Uniswap announced a $15.5 million bug bounty program, the largest in DeFi&#8217;s history, to secure its upcoming v4 protocol. The platform <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/v4-bug-bounty">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Over 500 researchers [had] participated in a $2.35 million security competition, and no critical vulnerabilities were found. As deployment approaches, we’re taking an extra step to ensure v4 is as secure as possible with the $15.5 million bug bounty.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Aave hits new highs</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/aave/">Aave</a>, the largest DeFi lending platform, has also reached a historic milestone.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/aave">DeFiLlama</a>, deposits on the platform have surged to $33 billion, representing a 230% increase since the start of the year.</p>
<p>If Aave were a US bank, this figure places Aave among the top 1.4% in deposits, surpassing notable institutions like SoFi.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/stani-kulechov/">Stani Kulechov</a>, Aave&#8217;s founder and CEO, highlighted this progress as the start of a financial revolution driven by decentralized platforms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the platform&#8217;s growth is also reflected in the performance of its native token, AAVE, which has climbed 112% in 2024. According to <em>CryptoSlate&#8217;s</em> data, the token recently hit a yearly high of $210 before settling at $200 as of press time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/celo/">Celo</a>, a prominent Layer-1 blockchain, has seen its native token dump 5% after its upcoming transition to an <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> Layer-2 network within <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/optimism/">Optimism&#8217;s</a> Superchain ecosystem turned &#8220;contentious.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Nov. 27, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>, the largest US-based crypto exchange, announced that it would not support Celo&#8217;s migration into a Layer 2 network. In contrast, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/tether/">Tether&#8217;s</a> CEO <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/paolo-ardoino/">Paolo Ardoino</a> confirmed the stablecoin issuer&#8217;s continued support for the network post-transition into the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p>Data from <em>CryptoSlate</em> showed that this uncertainty negatively impacted the network&#8217;s CELO token, which fell 5% to $<span class="holepunch holepunch-coin_price_usd">0.81039 at press time.</span></p>
<h2>Community reaction</h2>
<p>These diverging views sparked mixed reactions within the community, with many criticizing Coinbase&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>Marek Olszewski, CEO of Celo&#8217;s developer cLabs, <a href="https://x.com/marek_/status/1861900233460080650">expressed</a> disappointment with Coinbase&#8217;s stance. He <a href="https://x.com/marek_/status/1861900233460080650">questioned</a> whether this decision might deter other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible Layer-1 chains from embracing Ethereum&#8217;s Layer-2 scaling solutions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the founder of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/kraken/">Kraken&#8217;s</a> <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/kraken-eyes-defi-expansion-with-launch-of-ink-its-new-ethereum-layer-2-network/">Inkchain</a>, Andrew Koller, assured that his exchange would support the migration into an L2. He <a href="https://x.com/ak47ink/status/1861959538137854144">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Kraken and Ink [loves]</span><span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"> the superchain and are fully committed to Ethereum scaling and making Kraken work for Celo users. we&#8217;ve asked the relevant teams to explore this to see if we can hit everything in time for Jan. 16th.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the setback, Olszewski <a href="https://x.com/marek_/status/1861842855599522064">suggested</a> the Celo community could consider renaming its existing Layer-1 chain to &#8220;Celo Gold (CGLD)&#8221; to accommodate Coinbase&#8217;s current support framework. He hinted that this might simplify future adoption if Coinbase supports the Layer-2 upgrade.</p>
<h2>Community urges Coinbase to rethink</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/eigenlayer/">EigenLayer</a> founder Sreeram Kannan <a href="https://x.com/sreeramkannan/status/1861911269818974482">speculated</a> that Coinbase&#8217;s decision could stem from &#8220;an oversight&#8221; rather than outright opposition. He encouraged the exchange to revisit its stance, emphasizing the potential benefits of supporting Celo&#8217;s integration into the OP Stack.</p>
<p>Kannan stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think this is likely an oversight internally in Coinbase. There is no chance the company building the leading Ethereum L2 in users and a core contributor to OP public goods will choose to discontinue supporting Celo after it becomes an OP stack based L2.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, Nass Eddequiouaq, the CEO of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/a16z/">a16z</a>-funded crypto startup Bastion, highlighted the operational and regulatory complexities exchanges face when adding support for new chains, particularly in the US. He <a href="https://x.com/nassyweazy/status/1861989220031627584">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Exchanges and custodian have usually been waiting to see which branch of the fork picks up the activity before adding support for it and deprecating the other one.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He</span> <strong><a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1861802009021575237">shared</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 14 altcoin-related ETFs await approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the next 12 months, including funds giving exposure to Solana (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">SOL</a>), <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/xrp/">XRP</a>, Hedera (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/hedera/">HBAR</a>), Litecoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/litecoin/">LTC</a>), baskets of assets, and Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Balchunas expects the list of altcoin ETFs to triple in size in the next two months.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Favorable environment</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following President <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> victory in the US elections, ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci predicted that several spot crypto ETFs</span> <strong><a href="https://x.com/NateGeraci/status/1855794053423452381">would be listed</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He stated:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Assume multiple issuers were highly prepared for election results. No downside to getting aggressive now.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset managers registered three new ETF listings since Geraci&#8217;s publication. On Nov. 12, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/canary-capital/">Canary Capital</a></span> filed for<span style="font-weight: 400;"> an <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/canary-capital-files-application-for-a-spot-hbar-etf/">HBAR ETF</a>, which surprised some market analysts, given the expectation that issuers would choose more prominent crypto among the 50 largest by market cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/bitwise/">Bitwise</a> registered a</span> <strong><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitwise-registers-solana-trust-signalling-future-sec-application-for-sol-spot-etf/">SOL trust</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Delaware on Nov. 21, and five days later, NYSE</span> <strong><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/nyse-files-to-list-bitwises-bitcoin-and-ethereum-mixed-etp/">filed to list</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the asset manager&#8217;s mixed BTC and ETH ETF.</span></p>
<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Bloomberg ETF analyst <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/james-seyffart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Seyffart</a> believes that the SEC will likely approve Solana-related ETFs <a href="https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1861792629614059898">within two years</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he added that the current administration could &#8220;very easily&#8221; fail to acknowledge these ETFs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seyffart highlighted that this had already happened in August when the Cboe removed the 19b-4 Form filing to list <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/vaneck/">VanEck</a> and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/21shares/">21Shares&#8217;</a> Solana ETFs registered in July.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Litecoin ETF filed by Canary in October has a higher chance of approval. Alex Thorn, head of research at <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/galaxy-digital/">Galaxy Digital</a>,</span> <strong><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/canary-capital-files-s-1-application-for-first-spot-litecoin-etf-in-the-us/">previously told</a></strong> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoSlate</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the LTC launch is often considered fair, given the absence of a pre-mine or token sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the SEC&#8217;s position remains unclear, Thorn believes the regulator is unlikely to label LTC as a security.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NYSE Arca</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">filed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 19b-4 Form to list a Bitwise exchange-traded product (ETP) offering direct spot exposure to Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>), weighted by their market capitalization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Bitwise</span> <strong><a href="https://bitwiseinvestments.com/newsroom/nyse-arca-files-form-19b-4-for-bitwise-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etp">statement</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the proposed Bitcoin-Ether ETP aims at simplifying portfolio allocation for investors seeking exposure to the crypto market’s most established assets. Its market-cap weighting ensures that the fund dynamically adjusts to reflect these assets&#8217; evolving dominance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan stated:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“Bitcoin and ether aren’t competitors any more than gold and tech stocks are competitors. So when investors ask us which is better to add to their portfolio, often our answer is ‘both.’ This fund aims to make that recommendation easy and actionable, providing balanced exposure to the world’s two largest crypto assets. I think it’s going to be a huge hit with investors.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitwise&#8217;s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs have collectively amassed $4.2 billion in assets under management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If approved, this dual-asset ETP would be a first-of-its-kind product in the US market, allowing investors simultaneous exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, other similar products are also waiting for approval. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</span> <strong><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/sec-delays-decision-on-franklin-templetons-crypto-index-etf-to-2025/">recently delayed</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the approval of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/franklin-templeton/">Franklin Templeton&#8217;s</a> Crypto Index ETF, which tracks BTC and ETH, although it is not market cap-weighted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Brazilian asset manager Hashdex filed to launch a similar product in June, as the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF would track BTC and ETH. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different use cases</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CryptoSlate</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data, as of Nov. 26, BTC and ETH collectively had a market cap of over $2.1 trillion. Despite their dominance, investors usually perceive the two crypto use cases differently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors primarily regard Bitcoin as a digital store of value optimized for security and monetary use cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, ETH powers the Ethereum blockchain, the largest decentralized ecosystem for applications, boasting nearly $110 billion in total value locked (TVL) as per DefiLlama</span> <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>data</strong>.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Additionally, traditional finance giants like <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/blackrock/">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/visa/">Visa</a>, and Franklin Templeton chose the infrastructure to launch their products.</span></p>
