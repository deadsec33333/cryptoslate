										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A coalition of Canadian media organizations has launched a lawsuit against <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/openai/">OpenAI</a>, claiming the company&#8217;s ChatGPT product i<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/authors-guild-claims-openai-used-pirated-ebooks-to-train-chatgpt-on-copyrighted-material/">nfringed copyrights</a> by utilizing their journalism without authorization, according to a Nov. 29 court <a href="https://litigate.com/assets/uploads/Canadian-News-Media-Companies-v-OpenAI.pdf">filing</a>.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs include prominent outlets such as CBC/Radio-Canada, The Toronto Star, and The Globe and Mail. They are seeking damages and an injunction to prevent OpenAI from continuing to use their content.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, accuses OpenAI of extracting and profiting from Canadian news content without permission.</p>
<p>The group alleged:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;OpenAI is capitalizing on the use of our content, disregarding copyright laws and online terms of use.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>OpenAI defended its practices, stating that its AI models are trained on <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/openai-announces-time-partnership-amid-new-lawsuit-over-copyright-violations/">publicly available information</a> under the principles of fair use and related copyright laws. The company also highlighted its partnerships with news organizations and its opt-out options for publishers.</p>
<p>An OpenAI spokesperson told reporters:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;ChatGPT is used by millions worldwide to enhance creativity and solve complex problems. We collaborate with publishers to ensure attribution and offer tools for them to control how their content is engaged with on our platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the plaintiffs argue that OpenAI&#8217;s activities undermine the value of journalism by repurposing it for commercial gain. They also challenged OpenAI&#8217;s reliance on fair use, emphasizing that their journalism is intended to serve the public interest and should not be exploited for profit.</p>
<p>This case joins a growing number of lawsuits against OpenAI and other AI companies over the use of copyrighted materials for model training. Earlier this year, OpenAI acknowledged to a UK committee that training its current AI systems without incorporating copyrighted materials would not be feasible.</p>
<p>The company has also faced scrutiny for missteps, including a recent admission that engineers inadvertently erased critical evidence related to AI training data. The outcome of this case could have significant implications for copyright law in the AI era as courts grapple with the balance between innovation and intellectual property rights.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cookie DAO has introduced <a href="https://www.cookie.fun/">Cookie.fun</a>, a platform that tracks AI agents&#8217; performance in real-time across blockchain activity and social media.</p>
<p>The platform offers both human and AI investors a clear way to evaluate on-chain and market metrics for these rapidly growing agents.</p>
<h2>Tracking metrics in real-time</h2>
<p>AI agents — autonomous AI systems that can <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-offers-ai-agent-truth-terminal-its-own-crypto-wallet/">manage digital wallets</a>, execute transactions, and interact with users on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) — have emerged as a major trend in the crypto space.</p>
<p>While these agents have driven significant hype and rapid growth in market capitalization, evaluating their true impact has been challenging. Cookie.fun aims to provide a comprehensive dashboard to analyze on-chain and social activity for AI-driven agents.</p>
<p>The Cookie.fun platform tracks and ranks AI agents using metrics like market capitalization, social engagement, token holder growth, and impressions. It allows users to compare performance across leading agents, including GOAT, ZEROBRO, and ELIZA.</p>
<p>One standout feature is the &#8220;mindshare&#8221; ranking, which quantifies each agent&#8217;s influence across the market and social platforms. Recent data from the platform shows GOAT leading the pack in impressions, while ZEROBRO recorded significant growth in token holder numbers over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>These metrics, updated in real-time, help investors navigate the fast-moving AI agent ecosystem with clarity and confidence.</p>
<h2>AI agent wave</h2>
<p>AI agents, with their ability to interact autonomously across financial systems and social platforms, are seen as the next frontier for blockchain innovation. These agents are already driving token value and market narratives, as <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/autonomous-ai-agent-amasses-500000-in-crypto-after-spurring-memecoin-movement/">projects like Goatseus Maximus</a> and ELIZA demonstrate.</p>
<p>By offering a centralized hub for tracking their performance, Cookie.fun positions itself as a vital resource for investors looking to capitalize on this trend. As tools like Cookie.fun become more prevalent, they could usher in a new era of transparency and credibility for AI-driven projects, ensuring long-term sustainability in this burgeoning market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yu Xian, founder of the blockchain security firm Slowmist, has <a href="https://x.com/evilcos/status/1859818700389732513">raised alarms</a> about a rising threat known as AI code poisoning.</p>
<p>This attack type involves injecting harmful code into the training data of AI models, which can pose risks for users who depend on these tools for technical tasks.</p>
<h2>The incident</h2>
<p>The issue gained attention after a troubling incident involving OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT. On Nov. 21, a crypto trader named &#8220;r_cky0&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/r_cky0/status/1859656430888026524">reported</a> losing $2,500 in digital assets after seeking ChatGPT&#8217;s help to create a bot for <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">Solana</a>-based memecoin generator Pump.fun.</p>
<p>However, the chatbot recommended a fraudulent Solana API website, which led to the theft of the user&#8217;s private keys. The victim noted that within 30 minutes of using the malicious API, all assets were drained to a wallet linked to the scam.</p>
<p><em>[Editor&#8217;s Note: ChatGPT appears to have recommended the API after running a search using the new SearchGPT as a &#8216;sources&#8217; section can be seen in the screenshot. Therefore, it does not seem to be a case of AI poisoning but a failure of the AI to recognize scam links in search results.]</em></p>
<figure style="width: 1418px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gc7SoMDWYAAvsS6?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="AI scam link API (Source: X)" width="1418" height="958" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">AI scam link API (Source: X)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Further investigation revealed this address consistently receives stolen tokens, reinforcing suspicions that it belongs to a fraudster.</p>
<p>The Slowmist founder noted that the fraudulent API&#8217;s domain name was registered two months ago, suggesting the attack was premeditated. Xian furthered that the website lacked detailed content, consisting only of documents and code repositories.</p>
<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">While the poisoning appears deliberate, no evidence suggests <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/openai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI</a> intentionally integrated the malicious data into ChatGPT&#8217;s training, with the result likely coming from SearchGPT.</span></p>
<h2>Implications</h2>
<p>Blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer <a href="https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/1859765453536756130">noted</a> that this incident illustrates how scammers pollute AI training data with harmful crypto code. The firm said that a GitHub user, &#8220;solanaapisdev,&#8221; has recently created multiple repositories to manipulate AI models to generate fraudulent outputs in recent months.</p>
<p>AI tools like <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/chatgpt-drives-openai-toward-1b-revenue-goal-after-losing-540m-in-2022/">ChatGPT</a>, now used by hundreds of millions, face increasing challenges as attackers find new ways to exploit them.</p>
<p>Xian cautioned crypto users about the risks tied to large language models (LLMs) like GPT. He emphasized that once a theoretical risk, AI poisoning has now materialized into a real threat. So, without more robust defenses, incidents like this could undermine trust in <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-launches-new-tool-to-help-users-build-ai-agents-in-minutes/">AI-driven tools</a> and expose users to further financial losses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Currency Group (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/digital-currency-group/">DCG</a>) has</span> <strong><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241120332472/en/DCG-Launches-Yuma-A-New-Subsidiary-Focused-on-Accelerating-Decentralized-Intelligence">unveiled</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yuma, a new subsidiary dedicated to accelerating startups building decentralized intelligence projects using Bittensor’s infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the firm&#8217;s statement, the move is a strategic foray into converging crypto and artificial intelligence (AI), two sectors poised for exponential growth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DCG founder and CEO <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/barry-silbert/">Barry Silbert</a> will lead Yuma and aims to equip startups and enterprises with the capital, infrastructure, and technical expertise needed to develop applications on Bittensor’s decentralized, open AI network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silbert stated:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Just like Bitcoin revolutionized transparent, borderless money, we’re now entering an era of decentralized intelligence. Yuma provides startups and enterprises with the resources to deploy innovative ideas on Bittensor, creating a transformative AI platform accessible to all.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Creating on Bittensor</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bittensor is a decentralized AI network that enables global contributors to create, train, and access machine learning (ML) models in an open marketplace. The goal of its Yuma Consensus (YC) mechanism is to measure and fairly reward its contributions using its native token TAO. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> revealed in recent court filings that he personally intervened to stop <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/openai/">OpenAI</a> from launching an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018, a move he claimed would have severely damaged the organization&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s legal team disclosed the details in an <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/openai-co-founders-quit-amid-musks-legal-firestorm/">amended lawsui</a>t filed on Nov. 14, adding to the growing tensions between the billionaire and the AI research group he co-founded.</p>
<p>The filing alleged that OpenAI co-founders <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/people/sam-altman/">Sam Altman</a> and Greg Brockman proposed the ICO to address the nonprofit&#8217;s financial struggles.</p>
<p>However, Musk, who served as co-founder and was a significant donor rejected the plan outright, warning that issuing a token would undermine trust in OpenAI and compromise its mission to develop safe artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p>
<p>Musk stated in the filing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It would simply result in a massive loss of credibility for OpenAI and everyone associated with the ICO.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The decision highlighted internal tensions over how the organization could balance its ambitious goals with financial sustainability.</p>
<h2>Origins and funding challenges</h2>
<p>OpenAI launched in 2015 with the lofty goal of ensuring AGI benefits all of humanity.</p>
<p>Musk joined as a co-founder and contributed $44 million in funding while serving as co-chair of its board. The organization also attracted significant support from Silicon Valley&#8217;s elite, including Altman, who provided critical leadership and additional funding.</p>
<p>Despite these contributions, OpenAI struggled to sustain its operations financially by 2018. The proposed ICO, a popular fundraising method during the crypto boom of the time, aimed to generate significant capital but faced pushback from Musk, who feared it would conflict with OpenAI&#8217;s nonprofit values.</p>
<p>Court filings revealed that Musk even suggested merging OpenAI with Tesla to create a sustainable funding model. The proposed merger would have allowed Tesla&#8217;s AI resources to bolster OpenAI&#8217;s efforts while providing the nonprofit with a steady financial base.</p>
<p>However, the board did not pursue Musk&#8217;s idea, further straining relationships within the organization.</p>
<h2>OpenAi&#8217;s shift</h2>
<p>Musk left OpenAI&#8217;s board in February 2018, citing potential conflicts with Tesla&#8217;s own AI development projects. His departure marked a pivotal moment for the organization.</p>
<p>In 2019, OpenAI subsequently transitioned to a &#8220;capped-profit&#8221; model designed to attract substantial investment while limiting returns to stakeholders.</p>
<p>The shift enabled OpenAI to secure significant backing, including a $1 billion partnership with Microsoft that year. However, Musk&#8217;s lawsuit argues that this transition represented a departure from OpenAI&#8217;s original nonprofit mission and accuses the leadership of <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/elon-musk-files-new-lawsuit-accusing-openai-cofounders-of-profit-driven-betrayal/">fraud and federal racketeering</a>.</p>
<p>The amended complaint, filed in August, also added <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> as a defendant in the case, accusing the company of distorting the AI organization&#8217;s purpose through its financial involvement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OpenAI has filed a motion to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/openai-files-motion-to-dismiss-elon-musk-lawsuit-over-baseless-claims/">dismiss the case</a>, arguing that Musk&#8217;s claims are legally unfounded and are part of a broader strategy to gain a competitive advantage in the AI industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DecideAI has announced the integration of its biometric <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/decideai/">identity verification</a> solution, DecideID, into the Solana blockchain, aiming to enhance security and trust within the ecosystem. This move introduces Proof-of-Personhood (PoP) capabilities to Solana, ensuring that users are verified as unique individuals without the need for traditional Know-Your-Customer procedures.</p>
<p>Raheel Govindji, founder and CEO of DecideAI, commented,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;DecideID is positioned to set a new standard in identity verification across the blockchain space. The Solana integration is just the beginning, and we anticipate a significant surge in user growth and adoption&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The integration is expected to address longstanding vulnerabilities in Solana&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/solana-liquid-staking-token-jto-surges-85-post-exchange-debut-following-unique-airdrop-event/">airdrop</a> ecosystem, which has previously been susceptible to Sybil attacks and botting. By verifying real users through AI-driven facial recognition and liveness detection technologies, DecideID aims to prevent fraudulent activities and ensure fair token distributions.</p>
<p><a href="/coins/solana">Solana</a> developers will now have the opportunity to leverage DecideID&#8217;s identity verification tools to enhance the integrity of decentralized applications. This is particularly significant for <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-token-whalefarm-drops-99-after-latest-defi-exploit/">DeFi projects</a>, where ensuring that transactions are conducted by real and unique individuals adds a crucial layer of trust. The technology analyzes facial movement, depth, and micro-expressions to confirm user authenticity, utilizing Zero-Knowledge proofs to protect personal data during the verification process.</p>
<p>According to DecideAI, the integration will,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Add a layer of trust in lending, staking, and yield farming by ensuring that only real and unique humans are behind transactions.</p>
<p>Additionally, DecideID’s AI facial recognition technology doesn’t require any Know-Your-Customer procedures or documentation, making it an easy and quick scan for users.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The integration is currently in the testing phase and is expected to be fully launched before the end of the year. Upon release, Solana users will be able to link their wallets, participate in airdrops, and verify their personhood without extensive documentation. DecideAI is also in discussions with several Solana-based DeFi and NFT platforms that plan to adopt DecideID for enhanced security and fair governance participation.</p>
<p>This development is facilitated by the Internet Computer&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/dfinitys-new-api-boosts-internet-computer-smart-contracts-with-cross-chain-prowess/">Chain Fusion</a> technology, which allows for seamless protocol-level integration with other blockchains. The Internet Computer (ICP) acts as a powerful general-purpose blockchain and Web3 platform, enabling DecideID to extend its services beyond Solana with potential future integrations into networks like Ethereum.</p>
<p>DecideID reportedly has already verified over 14,000 unique users and aims to foster trust and accountability in decentralized applications. By preventing malicious activities and ensuring secure interactions, it contributes to a more transparent and fair blockchain environment.</p>
<p>Per the recent announcement, DecideAI&#8217;s mission extends beyond identity verification. It aims to reshape the landscape of large language models by prioritizing quality, collaboration, and ownership. Through its ecosystem comprising Decide Protocol, DecideID, and Decide Cortex, the company seeks to democratize access to AI resources while rewarding contributors and setting new standards for open-source collaboration.</p>
<h2>Proof of personhood protocols on the rise</h2>
<p>This integration places DecideID among notable Proof-of-Personhood initiatives such as World, Proof of Humanity, Idena, CorePass, and Anima Protocol.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/worldcoin-rebrands-as-world-targets-1-billion-users-with-new-blockchain-and-biometric-tech/">World</a> (formerly Worldcoin,) founded by Sam Altman, uses iris scans to generate unique identifiers for individuals, though it has faced privacy concerns over biometric data collection.</p>
<p>Proof of Humanity combines video verification with community endorsement to establish unique identities on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to facilitate fair distribution in Universal Basic Income projects.</p>
<p>Idena employs AI-resistant tasks called &#8220;flips&#8221; to ensure each node in its network represents a unique human, enhancing decentralization and resistance to Sybil attacks.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/ping-exchange-debuts-with-unique-corepass-id-authentication-and-native-crypto-trading/">CorePass,</a> on the Core Blockchain network, allows users to verify and tokenize credentials such as passports, driving licenses, emails, and names. Data can then be sold to dApps, allowing users to realize the value of their data instead of giving it away for free.</p>
<p>Anima Protocol provides decentralized identity services on the BNB Chain, focusing on privacy while verifying user authenticity.</p>
<p>These projects, like DecideID, showcase how blockchain can address challenges such as fraudulent activities and fair resource distribution in digital ecosystems, but each takes a different approach to balance security, privacy, and user experience.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Most venture capital and hedge funds expect Solana (SOL) to reach at least $600 in this bull cycle, according to the &#8220;Q4 2024 Crypto Investment Manager Survey” by MV Global.  Almost a third of the survey respondents believe SOL will breach the $600 ceiling, while 23.2% see this price area as the asset&#8217;s all-time high.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most venture capital and hedge funds expect Solana (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/">SOL</a>) to reach at least $600 in this bull cycle,</span><strong><a href="https://app-na1.hubspotdocuments.com/documents/45150296/view/910019394?accessId=d7287d"> according</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the &#8220;Q4 2024 Crypto Investment Manager Survey” by MV Global. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost a third of the survey respondents believe SOL will breach the $600 ceiling, while 23.2% see this price area as the asset&#8217;s all-time high. The same percentage see SOL stuck between $150 and $300 in this bull cycle, which the survey participants believe will happen in the second half of 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One liquid fund analyst stated that SOL and Ethereum (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/">ETH</a>) will outperform Bitcoin (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">BT</a>C) in this cycle, although SOL will have a much more significant upside. He added:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“It’s a straightforward way to capture the upside of multiple verticals like DePIN and Memecoins.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a venture capital fund analyst stated that SOL outperforming ETH is &#8220;so consensus it scares.&#8221; Additionally, 75% of the survey participants believe SOL will outperform crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in this cycle. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Not bullish enough</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey interviewed 76 top liquid funds and venture allocators in the crypto market. Half were venture capital funds, and 21.7% were hedge funds. Roughly 56% of the participants manage between $10 million and $50 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MV Global highlighted that “the lack of upside conviction” was surprising, particularly in Bitcoin’s case. Most survey respondents believe BTC will peak between $100,000 and $150,000, below predictions from institutional researchers such as VanEck and Standard Chartered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last six months of sideways action are the key factor for quenching investors’ sentiment, with the recent upside tail much less priced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey reveals that nearly 57% of the respondents believe Bitcoin will peak in 2025, with 45.7% seeing a new all-time high in next year’s second semester.</span></p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;Alt season&#8217; for a few</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also questioned the 76 participants about the possibility of a massive price increase for altcoins in this cycle. Almost 70% of the respondents firmly believe in an alt season, but only for a few selected altcoins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large venture capital partner told the survey:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“There are 100x more tokens than last cycle. It&#8217;s really hard to see all of these moving with a beta to BTC like they did in.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokens related to the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative are among the preferred by the survey respondents, with 43% of them keeping an eye out for this altcoin vertical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) comes in second, with 14.3% of the participants manifesting interest. Native tokens for DeFi applications are considered a good investment by 11.4% of the high net-worth asset managers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, gaming is the least favorite altcoin sector, as 27.5% consider it the &#8221; worst performer” in this cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A liquid fund managing partner said:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“You don’t need to have crypto companies create a game or a gaming studio. Integration is the best path forward. Don’t try and build the next Call of Duty but have Call of Duty adopt crypto.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Layer-2 blockchains&#8217; native tokens are also among the survey participants&#8217; least favorite digital assets, with 24.6% considering this a potential underperforming sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, asset managers for high-net-worth funds are still cautious about meme coins. Despite 43% declaring investments in tokens within this sector, only 10% used more than $10,000 from their respective funds to get exposure to this narrative. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/galaxy-digital/">Galaxy Digital</a> is the latest <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> mining firm exploring a shift to AI, driven by increasing competition and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/insights/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-reach-all-time-high-on-us-election-day/">rising mining difficulty</a> within the sector.</p>
<p>In its third-quarter earnings <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/407453138/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/Galaxy-Digital-Holdings-LP-Press-Release-9_30_2024.pdf">report</a> released on Nov. 7, Galaxy announced a preliminary agreement with an undisclosed US hyperscaler—a large data center operator—to potentially convert its 800-megawatt (MW) Helios mining facility in West Texas for high-performance computing (HPC). Hyperscalers offer immense computing capacity to support demanding applications like AI.</p>
<p>Currently, the Helios facility has 200 MW in operation, and Galaxy is investigating the feasibility of securing an additional 1.7 gigawatts (GW) of power capacity for the site. However, moving forward with this AI-focused plan will depend on thorough due diligence and necessary approvals.</p>
<p>Other major mining companies, like <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/riot-platforms-attracting-blue-chip-partners-for-ai-ventures-amid-q3-losses/">Riot Platforms</a> and <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/marathon-digital-hints-at-ai-pivot-following-bitcoin-production-slowdown-in-august/">Marathon Digital</a>, are also considering <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/terawulf-plans-to-scale-bitcoin-mining-ai-operations/">AI expansions</a>. Core Scientific, another prominent miner, is poised to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/core-scientifics-ai-deal-fuels-8-7-billion-revenue-forecast-shares-rise/">generate over $8 billion</a> through a 12-year partnership with AI-focused hyperscaler CoreWeave.</p>
<p>This strategy follows predictions by industry analysts that Bitcoin miners who embrace AI could unlock new revenue streams. Asset management firm <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/companies/vaneck/">VanEck</a> projects that Bitcoin miners could see up to $14 billion in annual profits by 2027 if they devote 20% of their energy resources to AI computations.</p>
<h2>Q3 results</h2>
<p>Galaxy&#8217;s third-quarter results further underscore the <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/post-halving-bitcoin-miners-are-choosing-between-hodling-btc-and-upgrading-to-ai/">challenges facing Bitcoin miners</a>. The firm reported a 27% drop in Bitcoin production, mining only 176 BTC during the third quarter, while revenue from mining declined 23% to $18.5 million.</p>
<p>This downturn came despite an 11% increase in Galaxy&#8217;s hashrate, which rose to 6.2 exahashes per second (EH/s). Galaxy attributed these results to April&#8217;s Bitcoin halving event, the heightened mining difficulty, and seasonal curtailment of energy use.</p>
<p>Overall, Galaxy reported a net loss of $54 million for the quarter, though this marked an improvement from the<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/galaxy-digital-posts-177-million-net-loss-in-q2-amid-market-turbulence/"> prior quarter&#8217;s net loss of $177 million</a>.</p>
<p>The company saw over 30% growth in operating revenue quarter-over-quarter despite industry-wide declines in trading volumes and a drop in Ethereum prices. Galaxy added that it recorded a net income of $191 million primarily due to strong operations and favorable market conditions for digital assets.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Imagine gaming in ultra-high-definition from any device, without the need for expensive hardware, and with the security of blockchain at your fingertips. DeepLink is making this possible—redefining cloud gaming by harnessing the power of decentralization and AI. With an intelligent, tokenized ecosystem, <a href="https://www.deeplink.cloud/"><span class="s1">DeepLink</span></a> isn’t just a cloud gaming platform; it’s a movement towards a more accessible, efficient, and secure future for gamers and GPU providers alike.</p>
<p class="p3">DeepLink is a decentralized cloud gaming platform that combines blockchain and AI technology to deliver high-performance gaming experiences. By leveraging a distributed network of GPU nodes, DeepLink aims to provide low-latency, cost-effective cloud gaming accessible on any device. In this article we will explore how DeepLink is disrupting the cloud gaming industry.</p>
<h2 class="p4"><b>Decentralized infrastructure for reduced latency</b></h2>
<p class="p1">The core of DeepLink&#8217;s approach is its decentralized network architecture. Rather than relying on centralized data centers, DeepLink taps into a global network of &#8220;Aether Edge&#8221; nodes contributed by GPU providers worldwide.</p>
<p class="p3">As a DeepLink spokesperson explained, &#8220;The distributed network of nodes brings computing power closer to users, reducing lag and improving the gameplay experience.&#8221; This decentralized infrastructure is powered by blockchain technology, which ensures the integrity and transparency of transactions and data within the ecosystem.</p>
<h2 class="p4"><b>AI-Driven resource allocation and optimization</b></h2>
<p class="p1">At the core of DeepLink&#8217;s platform is its sophisticated use of artificial intelligence to enhance the cloud gaming experience. The company leverages AI algorithms to dynamically manage and optimize the distribution of computing resources across its decentralized network.</p>
<p class="p1">As the DeepLink spokesperson explained, &#8220;Artificial intelligence is used to analyze gaming patterns and user behavior in real-time. This allows us to intelligently adjust graphics settings, network resources, and other parameters to maintain smooth, low-latency performance.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">The AI systems constantly monitor factors like individual device capabilities, network conditions, and game requirements. By predicting user needs and proactively allocating the appropriate GPU power and bandwidth, DeepLink is able to minimize latency and deliver a seamless gaming experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p5"><i>&#8220;Our AI-driven resource allocation is pretty smart about energy use as well,&#8221; the spokesperson noted. &#8220;It&#8217;s constantly optimizing, making sure we&#8217;re using just the right amount of power for each gaming session. No waste, no overkill.&#8221;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">This level of intelligent optimization is a key differentiator for DeepLink, allowing it to extract maximum performance from its decentralized infrastructure. The spokesperson emphasized that this AI-powered approach is critical to fulfilling the promise of cloud gaming at scale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p6"><i>&#8220;Traditional cloud gaming services often struggle with latency and consistency issues. But by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, we&#8217;re able to overcome those challenges and provide a truly next-level gaming experience, no matter the device or location.&#8221;</i><i></i></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p4"><b>Tokenized ecosystem incentivizes GPU providers</b></h2>
<p class="p1">At the heart of DeepLink&#8217;s model is a tokenized economy centered around the DLC token. When users rent GPU resources to play games, they pay DLC tokens, which are then destroyed. GPU providers receive DLC rewards for contributing their computing power to the network.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-451376" src="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image1.jpg" alt="" width="936" height="516" srcset="https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image1.jpg 936w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image1-300x165.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image1-768x423.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><i>&#8220;This pledging system gives us a level of certainty that traditional systems can&#8217;t match,&#8221; the spokesperson said. &#8220;We know exactly how much computing power we have available at any given time, and smart contracts automatically adjust rewards based on providers&#8217; performance.&#8221;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">The spokesperson emphasized that this creates a mutually beneficial ecosystem: &#8220;Providers are incentivized to offer the best service possible, and gamers get a reliable, high-quality experience. It&#8217;s a win-win situation, all powered by the magic of blockchain and smart contracts.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="p2"><b>Benefits for gamers and GPU providers</b></h2>
