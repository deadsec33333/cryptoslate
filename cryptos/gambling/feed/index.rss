										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shuffle, a prominent crypto casino renowned for its exceptional user experience and trustworthiness, was launched on February 1st, 2023. The introduction of the Shuffle Token (SHFL) marks a significant stride towards enhancing the overall crypto casino experience.</p>
<h2>SHFL Token Features and Innovations</h2>
<p>Players utilizing SHFL have expressed dissatisfaction with conventional casinos due to subpar user experiences, lackluster bonuses, and native tokens that fail to enhance gameplay. SHFL is poised to revolutionize the casino industry by introducing innovations like Wager-to-Vest, enhancing user engagement through airdrop campaigns, and prioritizing active users to elevate the gaming experience.</p>
<h2>SHFL Token Circulation and Utilities</h2>
<p>The SHFL token, with a total supply of 1,000,000,000, was launched on March 14, 2024, with 39,316,004 tokens sold through a liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP). The circulating supply includes tokens from the LBP, liquidity reserves, and a portion of Airdrop 1, with additional supply generated through vested airdrops and liquidity mining. SHFL&#8217;s utilities encompass serving as a wager asset, implementing a buyback-and-burn mechanism, and granting holders exclusive access to new features and bonuses.</p>
<h2>Founders and Vision of Shuffle</h2>
<p>Founded by Noah Dummett, Bainy Zhang, and Darcy Spangler, Shuffle&#8217;s team brings extensive experience from leading web3 entities like Alameda Research, Bitmex, and Three Arrows Capital. With a focus on delivering an immersive and secure gaming environment, the team aims to establish SHFL as the premier destination for crypto gaming enthusiasts, leveraging blockchain technology for transparency, fairness, and cutting-edge features.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PKR (PKR) is a global utility token movement powered by a number of patented protocols that are aimed at addressing common problems in the blockchain industry. The ecosystem is working to provide fair gameplay for online gaming, create a true random number generator, contribute to the introduction of interoperability to the cryptocurrency scene and build a secure environment for the launch of new projects in the industry.</p>
<p>Before growing into a multifunctional ecosystem PKR had the main goal of building a crypto-poker gaming protocol called Polker. At the present time Polker.game is the first NFT, play-to-earn blockchain-based game powered by PKR.</p>
<p>The platform’s utility token PKR serves to maintain the economy inside of the ecosystem. As stated in the official whitepaper, staking of the PKR allows holders to receive an annual percentage yield, which will slowly reduce over time as the PKR’s Total Value Locked (TVL) increases.</p>
<p>PKR token first went live in June 2021. The game testnet deployment took place towards the end of 2021 with the launch on the mainnet coming in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
